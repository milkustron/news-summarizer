0,"If you consider flying one of life’s miseries, you might be flying the wrong airline.

A new survey suggests that air travel is slowly improving, led by a small group of airlines.

Passengers who fly JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines had the highest satisfaction rating — 800 and 781, respectively, out of a possible score of 1000, according to J.D. Power’s latest North America Airline Satisfaction study.

Overall passenger satisfaction with major airlines increased to 717 out of a possible score of 1000 in 2015, up from 712 a year ago, according to J.D. Power’s study.

Here are some of the major findings:

The study gauged passenger satisfaction among both business and leisure passengers in several key areas, including costs, fees, in-flight services, onboard experience and reservations. It was conducted between April 2014 and March 2015. J.D. Power distinguishes between “traditional” and “low-cost” carriers in its ranking, but Fortune combined them for this report.

The findings reflect another recent study on airline service, which also suggested airline service was trending higher.

To put these scores into a little perspective, the top-ranked airline would receive an equivalent letter grade of “B-.” The highest-scoring legacy carrier, Delta Air Lines, would get a “C-.” The lowest-ranked carriers receive a grade of “D,” according to its customers.

Airlines still rank below banks and mortgage lenders, two other industries covered by J.D. Power. “Airline customer service experience is low,” says Rick Garlick, global travel and hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power. “But it’s getting better.”

What the findings mean for customers

J.D. Power says the findings show that customer service matters, perhaps now more than ever. In its view, the airline industry is evolving from a commoditized transportation business into a business focused on hospitality and services.

“The carriers most focused on providing a pleasant experience are being rewarded with higher customer satisfaction and loyalty,” says Garlick.

He says the study suggests that when passengers make the decision to fly an airline based on the services or experience the airline provides, rather than price, convenient routes and scheduling, satisfaction is higher and passengers are more likely to return to the airline brand and to recommend it to others.

But there’s another reason for the uptick in scores, and they have nothing to do with better service.

“People have adapted to the airline fees that use to upset them,” adds Garlick. “So it might be more accurate to say people are less dissatisfied.”

A closer look at the J.D. Power numbers shows how various airlines succeeded — and failed.

American and Delta surged ahead by investing in their customer service infrastructure and training, with an emphasis on high-revenue business travelers. Alaska’s downward swing can be explained by some of its growing pains, as it expands to new cities where passengers are less familiar with the brand. And the failure of airlines such as United and Frontier? Garlick says those airlines have focused on low fares and high fees, to the detriment of customer service.

“Everyone wants low-cost travel,” he adds. “But there’s a price to be paid for it. The low-ranked carriers are running their companies so frugally that not even their core customers are satisfied. They’re willing to pay for a better experience.”

A long way to go

Critics agree that airline service still has a way to go before it can be considered good. “As the airlines have been complaining that customers are treating their seats like commodities, the airlines themselves are treating their passengers — except frequent flier elites and first class — like self-loading cargo,” says Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, an advocacy organization for air travelers. “Onboard services have been ratcheted back, extra and exorbitant fees are being loaded on passengers, and legroom and seat sizes continue to shrink.”

Leocha says investing in customer service doesn’t have to be expensive. A simple smile from flight attendants or gate agents, waiving a standby fee to get on an earlier flight with empty seats, allowing families to sit together without paying more, all make the travel experience far more pleasant.

“Unfortunately,” he adds, “these amenities still seem to be in short supply.”",J.D.

1,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is demanding PayPal return $15 million to consumers and pay a $10 million fine for problems with its PayPal Credit service, according to a new federal court complaint.

“Tens of thousands of consumers who were attempting to enroll in a regular PayPal account, or make an online purchase, were signed up for the credit product without realizing it,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement about the suit.

One big problem, the bureau claims, is that PayPal set the default payment method for all purchases to PayPal Credit, formerly named “Bill Me Later.”

And even for those customers who signed up willingly, the company failed to honor advertised promotions, like $5 or $10 credits toward purchases, the CFPB alleges.

Perhaps worst of all, Cordray notes, is the Kafka-esque nightmare many customers faced once they were enrolled.

“PayPal failed to post payments properly, lost payment checks, and mishandled billing disputes that consumers had with merchants or the company itself,” he said. “Numerous consumers reported that the company took more than a week to process payment checks. And even when customers were unable to pay because of website failures, they still got charged late fees.”

If a judge approves the complaint, PayPal will have to reimburse customers who were mistakenly enrolled in PayPal Credit, who mistakenly paid for a purchase with PayPal Credit, and/or who incurred fees or deferred interest as a result of the company’s “inadequate disclosures and flawed customer-service practices.”

You could be eligible if you incurred late fees or interest charges between January 1, 2011, and May 1, 2015.

2,"South Korea has accused North Korea of planting landmines that maimed two soldiers on border patrol, sending military tensions on the Korean peninsula soaring as it threatened to make Pyongyang pay a ""harsh price"".

The Defence Ministry said it believed three landmines exploded in the incident last Tuesday, hitting a patrol in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) - a buffer zone stretching two kilometres on either side of the actual frontier line dividing the two Koreas.

""We are certain they were North Korean landmines planted with an intention to kill by our enemies who sneaked across the military border,"" ministry spokesman Kim Min-Seok told reporters.

One soldier underwent a double leg amputation, while the other had one leg removed.

In a statement, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said its military would make North Korea ""pay a harsh price proportionate for the provocation it made"".

Describing the attack as a ""baseless act"" and ""wanton violation"" of non-aggression accords, the statement urged the North to apologise for the attack and punish those responsible.

The last direct attack on the South was in December 2010 when North Korea shelled the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, killing two civilians and two soldiers and triggering brief fears of a full-scale conflict.

The rival Koreas remain technically at war because their 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a cease-fire rather than a peace treaty.

The UN Command that monitors the cease-fire accord said on Monday that it had conducted a special investigation into last week's blasts and concluded they were from North Korean ""wooden box"" land mines placed on a known South Korean border patrol path.

""The investigation determined that the devices were recently emplaced, and ruled out the possibility that these were legacy landmines which had drifted from their original placements,"" it said in a statement.

More than a million mines are believed to have been planted along the inter-Korean border, including those which were air-dropped in great numbers in the 1960s at the height of a Cold War confrontation with the North.

The incident comes at a sensitive time, with both Koreas preparing to commemorate the 70th anniversary on Saturday of the 1945 liberation of the Korean peninsula from Japanese rule.

There had been hopes that the anniversary might open an opportunity for some sort of rapprochement, but efforts to organise a joint commemoration went nowhere with Pyongyang refusing to consider talks because of Seoul's refusal to cancel annual joint military exercises with the United States.

3,"The credit card you have in your wallet to save on gas may hurt you when you're not at the pump.

Gas station-branded credit cards charge an average interest rate of 24 percent, according to a new survey from CreditCards.com. That is miles above the 15 percent average levied by all credit cards, and higher than the 23 percent average charged on retailer cards.

The rewards from gas cards are running on empty, too. The typical gas card offers a 10-cent discount per gallon, which works out to a 4 percent return based on current prices. Not a bad perk right now, but once gas prices rise, the savings drop.

While other card issuers offer sign-up bonuses as much as $100 for high-quality borrowers, gas cards throw out a couple extra pennies per gallon for the first few months to welcome new customers.

""People with good credit can find better deals elsewhere,"" said Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com's senior analyst, who recommends regular credit cards that offer cash back on gas.

Collagen is a fibrous protein that makes up part of the connective tissues in our bodies. The body needs collagen as it helps with skin elasticity and for ""looking youthful."" However, as we get older, the production of collagen in the body slows down.

In 2006, Naoya Matsuda of the Hirosaki University School of Medicine and others published a paper on the ""effects of ingestion of collagen peptide,"" which suggested that ingestion of collagen peptide could improve ""the mechanical strength of the skin"" and reduce skin injury; however further research was needed.

However, sufficient evidence to demonstrate that ingesting collagen is beneficial has yet to be seen. Many have come forward saying that eating collagen will not have any skin benefit, including the British Skin Foundation.

5,"In what may be the last hurrah for public buildings before government spending cuts bite, prizes for architectural quality were awarded to 17 new school and university buildings by the Royal Institute of British Architects today.

From a £27m art and design academy at Liverpool John Moores University to a multicoloured glass extension at Clapham Manor primary school, education buildings won almost a fifth of the RIBA's 93 awards in a feat that may not be repeated for a generation after the government ordered a moratorium on new plans for school buildings.

The new education secretary, Michael Gove, recently clashed with architects when he accused them of ""creaming off cash"" that should have been going to the frontline.

The RIBA roll of honour also reveals the damaging effect of recession on architectural opportunity: instead of the stadium, airport and museum projects of previous years, the 2010 list features more modest projects, including a bus drivers' toilet in Dagenham and a black-clad electricity sub-station on a 2012 Olympic site in east London. And, with house building falling to an 87-year low, just three housing schemes were granted awards.

Many of the country's leading designers, including Zaha Hadid, David Chipperfield and Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, won accolades for buildings elsewhere in the EU rather than at home. Hadid's expressionist angles and curves were reserved for Rome's museum of 21st-century art, MAXXI, while Lord Rogers, widely regarded as one of the world's leading modernists, designed a new headquarters campus for a Spanish technology company in Seville.

""The RIBA awards reflect not only the state of British architecture but also that of its economy,"" said Ruth Reed, the institute's president. ""In the midst of the deepest recession in the awards' 45-year history, this year demonstrates that, although times might be hard for architects, there are still great buildings being built throughout the country and overseas. The RIBA awards always give an opportunity for gem-like small projects and less established practices to shine through, and this year is no exception. Far from being a size prize, the RIBA awards are for buildings that offer value to people's lives.""

The memorial in Hyde Park to the victims of the 7 July 2005 bomb attacks on the London transport network, by Carmody Groarke, also won and is considered by some as a possible contender for the shortlist for the £20,000 Stirling prize for building of the year, which is drawn from the RIBA award winners.

Ellis Woodman, architecture critic at the newspaper Building Design, said that other strong Stirling prize contenders included the Nottingham contemporary arts centre, the new British embassy in Warsaw, the Neues Museum in Berlin, Christ's College school in Guildford and Hadid's MAXXI museum.

The Oregon-born architect Rick Mather won most awards, gaining four. Other winning buildings included a new home in Bristol for Wallace and Gromit's creators, Aardman Animations, and a cluster of foil-clad small-business units, which look like cybermen helmets, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, in Wales.",Fifth of RIBA's annual architecture plaudits go to education projects – but now cuts will bite,"Generated Summary: In what may be the last hurrah for public buildings before government spending cuts bite, prizes for architectural quality were awarded to 17 new school and university buildings by the Royal Institute of British Architects today."
6,"Yields on 10-year US Treasurys will hold and stocks will bounce, fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach told CNBC on Tuesday.

Gundlach said 2.20 percent should be the low in interest rates on the 10-year, and that sentiment was driving rates moreso than data. The benchmark bond was most recently yielding 2.222%. (What are bonds doing now? Click here)

Even so, he also cautioned that any move under 2.20 percent would be a game-changer for the Federal Reserve in terms of policy. The Fed is generally expected to raise interest rates in mid-to-late 2015, though as the global economy cools some have suggested the timeline could change.

Last month, Gundlach forecast rates would stay in a range of 2.2 percent to 2.8 percent for the rest of the year.

Gundlach said the day of the Alibaba IPO was probably the top for stocks for this year. The Dow hit its 2014 high that day at 17,350.64 and has since shed nearly 1,000 points.

He also forecast the dollar would continue to rise, even as he described the strong-dollar trade as crowded.

Bill Scannell lost his son, Emmett, to a heroin overdose last week. Along with Emmett's mother, Amy, they decided to intentionally expose the truth behind their son's death in a passionately written obituary.

""If parents are too afraid to put it in an obituary, how is the rest of the world going to see it?"" asked Scannell.

Scannell urges parents to keep your eyes open and watch for signs.

8,"Playboy's first non-nude issue has been on sale for the past month, and the media empire claims its re-robed strategy is working with advertisers.

The 63-year-old magazine's March issue featured 42 advertising pages, which is a 55.5 percent increase from the same issue last year. In addition, 1,200 more newsstands carried the issue, and Playboy claims it's selling well. About 75 percent of the stock has sold out at Barnes & Noble.

""What we were experiencing (before the switch) is we would get in a lot of proposals from consumer-facing brands for huge digital ad buys, then there would be hesitancy before we could actually close the insertion order,"" said Playboy CEO Scott Flanders. ""Now we're getting requests for proposals asking us for ideas.""

In fact, the company claims that ever since it announced the new direction in October, it has held more than 300 meetings with new and existing advertisers. Print advertisers in the March issue include brands such as Stolichnaya Premium Vodka, which has been an advertiser since the 1980s, and Dodge, which was the magazine's first Detroit-based auto advertiser in 25 years. Dodge also was a sponsor Playboy's Super Bowl party in San Francisco this year.

Meanwhile, Flanders said the safe-for-work strategy, which it has been employing on Playboy.com since August 2014, has led to a 400 percent growth in its online audience. It now gets 16 million unique global visitors per month, and 31 million users across its social media platforms. More importantly, the median age of visitors dropped from 47 to a much more advertiser desirable 30.5 during the same period.

As a result of its larger footprint, Flanders said Playboy's digital ad revenue is up 75 percent compared to the first quarter of 2015. Todd Alchin, partner and chief creative strategist at media buying and planning agency Noble People, agreed that Playboy's strong name recognition still gives it a leg up, and jokes aside, the magazine has always had a commitment to journalistic articles.

But Alchin pointed out that it faces challenges because of the decline of the publishing business overall. The non-nude announcement may have driven up publicity, causing a flood of new advertisers. However, that attention may not last.

In addition, Alchin said that while it is true that companies are more comfortable with safe-for-work brands, the idea of them shying away from adult titles is starting to fade. Just recently, clothing brand Diesel ran a huge ad campaign on the porn website, Pornhub.

""I don't doubt the (Playboy) numbers,"" said Alchin. ""I just doubt the longevity of it. I don't want to suggest they can't build a solid product without nudity. I just think it's too early to make that call.""

Still, Playboy's Flanders insists that becoming safe for work has also helped with licensing, which has always been a non-nude part of the business. Its largest licensee skin and body care company Coty — which does almost $200 million in wholesale Playboy-licensed item business annually — is considering a return to the U.S. market. It is also launching its second seasonal collaboration with clothing brand Joyrich.

It's hard to deny the print magazine's declining circulation rates. Per the company, in March of last year it had 750,000 subscribers. This past March, it was just 500,000. In the mid-1970s, Playboy had circulation of about six million.

Playboy did add that it reset its ad rate base numbers — the figure used to compute the price per ad — in 2016 in order to eliminate subscribers that are getting free issues or not paying the full rate, which is often included in other magazine's circulation numbers. If those people are included, the numbers would be around 600,000. The publication are hopeful that the figures will increase again with the more safe-for-work issues.

""The massive press attention to move to non-nude (in the print edition) has garnered almost 7 billion media impressions,"" said Flanders. ""It remains our 5th Avenue storefront, and there is a credibility. Our contributors feel they want to be in print. We continue to draw luminaries for that, I'm not sure we would receive the same attention for important influencers without the print product.""

The declining numbers are an issue that most men's print magazines are facing. FHM and Details folded last year. Maxim also cut its ad rate base to 900,000 from 2 million in October.

Flanders dismissed the worrisome category, saying that because of Playboy's strong brand name and large digital audience, it considers its place in the media landscape to be more in line with Buzzfeed and Vice.

Both of the TV journalists (could either one be even be considered a “journalist” anymore?) were in rare agreement last week that GOP candidate Donald Trump finally crossed a fat, red line by appearing to call on “2nd Amendment people” to assassinate his White House rival, Hillary Clinton.

The Trump campaign’s later clarification that he was really suggesting the lobbying power of the National Rifle Association could be used to stop Clinton legislation was, of course, ridiculous.

That Trump seems to need people watering down or translating his outrageous suggestions almost every day is a red flag.

That such diametrically opposed TV personalities like Rather and Scarborough are on the same page regarding such comments?

He added: “A bloody line has been crossed that cannot be ignored. At long last, Donald Trump has left the Republican Party few options but to act decisively and get this political train wreck off the tracks before something terrible happens.”

Rather, the former CBS newsman who has been accused for years of harboring a liberal bias, was just as blunt in a Facebook post on Wednesday.

“By any objective analysis, this is a new low and unprecedented in the history of American presidential politics,” Rather wrote. “This is no longer about policy, civility, decency or even temperament. This is a direct threat of violence against a political rival.”

We're shedding a deep, (outdated) tear for the VCR.

The world's last producer of home-use video cassette recorders pulled the plug on its production line at the end of July ending an epic 40-year odyssey that revolutionized home entertainment and paved the way for DVDs, DVRs and today's streaming, on-demand programming.

Funai Electronics in Japan cited declining sales and difficulty finding parts as the reason why it's ending production of the once revolutionary machine.

Hillary Clinton blasts Donald Trump's self-serving economic plan

Back in the day Funai sold up to 15 million VCRs annually, competing against the likes of RCA, JVC, Panasonic, Sony and Toshiba. The others stopped making the machines years ago, but in 2015 Funai's built only 750,000 units — barely enough to cover the costs of their production.

VCRs allowed consumers to watch movies at home, whenever they wanted to. Up until that point, you had to actually show up at a certain time and tune into a certain station to watch a show.

It also was responsible for a catchphrase: ""Be kind, please rewind"" — which actually was a thing. You could be charged extra for not rewinding your rental tape before returning it to the store.

Mostly, the gadgets freed viewers from the network's manipulative schedules and put the fear of technology into advertisers because consumers could now fast-forward through commercials.

The man, whose identity is concealed by suppression orders, pleaded not guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Friday to seven offences including attempted murder and indecent assault.

The charges, which include allegations he used a hammer, relate to an attack on two women at Salt Creek, in the Coorong National Park, in February.

The man appeared by video link and was remanded in custody to appear in the Supreme Court on September 26.

He is also charged with detaining a person, causing harm with intent, assault and endangering life, including an allegation he drove at or over one of the backpackers in his car.

In a previous appearance the court was told extensive material had been recovered from a mobile phone and two laptop computers seized from a man.

Prosecutor Sarah Attar described the material extracted as ""voluminous"" and indicated it would be handed over to defence counsel.

At that stage the only outstanding material was a medical report from a doctor at the Flinders Medical Centre.

With the man's committal for trial, statutory suppression orders on his identity lapsed.

But Ms Attar successfully applied for his identity to remain concealed in the ""interests of the proper administration of justice"".

Magistrate Brett Dixon suppressed the man's name and image and anything else that might identify him.

Adrian Oorloff pleaded guilty to incitement to kidnap after paying an undercover police officer $5000 to snatch the man.

He even attached a tracking device to the man's car and handed over two syringes filled with GHB to immobilise the victim.

Oorloff told the police officer after the kidnapping he planned to make the man ""disappear without a trace"".

As well as admitting to the kidnapping plot, the 48-year-old pleaded guilty to four drugs charges, including trafficking methylamphetamine, and possessing cartridge ammunition.

Judge Michael Bourke said Oorloff planned to have his lover's ex disappear by having him kidnapped, drugged with GHB, and incinerated at a rural property in Skye.

Oorloff also provided the police officer, known as ""Daz"", a body of evidence about the victim and his family including photographs, employment status and information from a tracking device he had attached to their cars.

When police raided his home and office they found a third syringe, schedule four poisons, cannabis, and a trafficable amount of methamphetamine.

In sentencing Oorloff in the County Court on Wednesday, Judge Bourke described his actions as ""serious and disturbing"".

The judge said he caused a high level of psychological damage to his intended target, which was evident in a victim impact statement previously read to the court.

The man said he and his siblings were forced to go into hiding, moving 14 times in six weeks - it was not clear to the court on Wednesday if this occurred before or after police alerted them to the plot.

""You caused them fear, paranoia and vulnerability,"" Judge Bourke said on Wednesday, noting they would need ongoing psychological treatment.

Oorloff was sentenced to six years and three months jail, within a minimum of four years and three months before he is eligible for parole.

Dressed in a pinstripe grey suit with dark rimmed glasses, Oorloff showed little emotion and stared forward as he stood in the dock during sentencing.

13,"Economists doubt there will be an interest rate cut when the Reserve Bank board meets on Melbourne Cup Day after new inflation figures showed slightly higher price pressures than expected.

This was the result of a sharp jump in fruit and vegetable prices, followed by rising electricity costs during the September quarter.

The consumer price index rose 0.7 per cent in the quarter, almost double the growth of the previous three months, but still left the annual rate at a meagre 1.3 per cent.

The annual rate, and the more interest-rate-sensitive underlying measures of inflation, remain comfortably below the central bank's two to three per cent target band, suggesting the cash rate won't be rising anytime soon.

Financial markets wound back any thought of a cut in the cash rate when the central bank board meets on Tuesday, following the data.

""The risk of a surprise Melbourne Cup day rate cut looks to have passed,"" Macquarie Research economist James McIntyre said.

The Reserve Bank had cut the cash rate in May and August after the previous quarterly inflation readings, and the rate now stands at a record low 1.5 per cent.

Fruit prices soared 19.5 per cent in the quarter, followed by vegetables up 5.9 per cent and electricity increasing by 5.4 per cent.

South Australia saw the largest proportional increase in electricity prices, a major concern for business, SA senator Nick Xenophon says.

""Energy costs ... are worth a lot more than any tax cut that is being offered by the federal government,"" Senator Xenophon told reporters in Canberra.

He said Treasury's own modelling shows the company cuts will have a minuscule impact in terms of economic growth.

Treasurer Scott Morrison was in SA on Wednesday for a business roundtable.

He took the opportunity to gee-up Senator Xenophon and his team to support the government's 10-year business tax plan and back improvements to the budget.

""When the Labor Party is going to vote against improving the budget ... (the Xenophon team) sit in the box seat here and they can't squib it,"" Mr Morrison told 5AA Adelaide radio.

Senator Xenophon said ""megaphone negotiations"" are not the best way of doing things.

""I'm happy to do that - the next time I'm here I'll bring my megaphone,"" Senator Xenophon said.

He described it as a ""very big Rubic's cube"" because the government also wants to have $6 billion of welfare cuts and says the impact of those could be quite severe among the disadvantaged.

If successful, the company tax rate will be cut to 25 per cent from 30 per cent for all businesses by 2026/27.

In the interim, it would be lowered to 27.5 per cent for business earning under $10 million now, for those with a $25 million turnover in 2017/18 and then to $$50 million in 2018/19.

The Xenophon team supports only the initial tranche of tax cuts, while Labor wants a cut limited to companies with an annual turnover of up to $2 million.","Economists expect official inflation figures will show continued subdued price pressures, but probably not benign enough for the RBA to cut the cash rate.",Generated Summary: Economists doubt there will be an interest rate cut when the Reserve Bank board meets on Melbourne Cup Day after new inflation figures showed slightly higher price pressures than expected.
14,"Sergio Pininfarina, the former chairman of the Italian design firm that bore his name, died in July 2012 at age 85.

He has been honoured at the 2013 Geneva motor show with a sporting concept that could very well reach low-volume production.

The Sergio is based on the celebrated Ferrari 458 Spider, as is evident from a cursory glance at the familiar interior. The car not only has no roof, it has no windshield. Pininfarina representatives assured the throngs on 5 March, the first day of press previews in Geneva, that the aerodynamics have been configured to create a “virtual windscreen”. At speed, air is directed over the heads of passengers rather than into their faces.

For all that, occupants would likely be grateful for the two helmets supplied.

The Sergio wears classic two-seat barchetta lines, but the effect is radical rather than retro. From some angles it appears as if the front is the back – an effect abetted by the lack of a windshield, as well as a swooping integrated rear wing. The Sergio is quick, too: Pininfarina says it would not quite do 200mph, but would run from zero to 62mph in less than 3.4 seconds, thanks to the 4.5-litre V8 engine combining with a meagre 1280kg kerb weight.

15,"A vicious, hate-filled letter written by the FBI and sent to American civil rights champion Martin Luther King has been made public in full for the first time.

The single-paged anonymous letter was sent to King in 1964, calling him a ""complete fraud and a great liability,"" an ""evil, abnormal beast,"" and threatening to expose his marital infidelities in an apparent bid to make him commit suicide.

Heavily redacted copies of the letter have circulated for years, but the New York Times on Wednesday published the note almost in its entirety, blanking out a woman's name.

The letter highlights the hostile attitude the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at the time run by J Edgar Hoover, had toward King and the civil rights movement.

According to the Times, it was written by one of Hoover's deputies, William Sullivan, and was apparently sent along with an audio recording containing evidence of King's extramarital affairs.

""Listen to yourself you filthy, abnormal animal,"" the letter reads.

""You have been on the record -- all your adulterous acts, your sexual orgies extending far into the past. This one is but a tiny sample.""

When King received the letter, he told friends that someone wanted him to kill himself, the Times reported.

The letter goes on to tell King: ""There is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is"" -- an apparent exhortation for him to kill himself.

The letter was crafted to make it appear it came from someone within the civil rights movement, making a reference to ""us Negroes"".

""You could not believe in God and act as you do,"" the letter states.

""Clearly you don't believe in any personal moral principles.""

The document provides a compelling illustration of how deeply paranoid the FBI had become under the stewardship of Hoover, whose name still adorns the federal police agency's Washington headquarters.

Hoover believed King was being influenced by communists, and King accused the FBI of failures in stopping violence against blacks in the segregated Deep South.

In 1963, King famously made his ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington during an enormous rally in the nation's capital.

The march helped set the stage for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlawed major forms of racial discrimination, followed a year later by the Voting Rights Act, designed to guarantee the franchise for all black US citizens.

King was gunned down by a sniper in 1968.

16,"The recent closing of the Reading Athletic Club in Reading is the latest example of the potential risks of gym memberships.

These clubs are no different than other businesses — some thrive, some struggle. What is different is that members often sign contracts, pay in advance, and leave credit card or account information on file.

So, when a club goes under, it’s not unusual for the event to generate complaints from consumers who spent money on services they won’t receive. Calls to the Reading Athletic Club, for instance, are greeted with a recording that the number has been disconnected.

The Better Business Bureau said it has been peppered with complaints from members about the sudden closing. It’s highly unlikely anyone will recover money. All they can do is try to get their credit card companies to reverse transactions because they did not receive the services.

The gym’s closing provides a reminder that before you sign a contract, know what you’re agreeing to and make sure you’re joining an operation you’ll like and use.

The Better Business Bureau offers these tips to help choose a gym:

■ Shop around. Ask friends and co-workers for recommendations.

■ Check out the facilities. Visit the club on a day and time you plan to use it to see how busy it is and whether it has the amenities you want. Assess its cleanliness.

■ Talk to members about whether they are satisfied.

■ Ask questions of staff to see whether they are helpful and qualified.

■ Review the contract. Get pressure to sign? Leave. Ask to take home the contract and read it. What’s included? What’s not? How much will it cost every month?

■ Be clear about the terms of membership. How long is it? Can you go month-to-month? What are the cancellation rules?

State law allows consumers three days to cancel a health club contract, although there are specific rules about how that must be done. You can also cancel if you move more than 25 miles from one of the operator’s gyms or have medical reasons preventing you from using the club for three months or more.","Before you sign a contract, know what you’re agreeing to and make sure you’re joining a gym that you’ll like.",Generated Summary: The recent closing of the Reading Athletic Club in Reading is the latest example of the potential risks of gym memberships.

18,"Nearly two years after its first public hearings on the matter, the Federal Trade Commission finally weighed in with new native advertising guidelines for print and digital publishers.

While it does not require full disclosure that all sponsored content is an ad, the FTC is pushing for some variation of the word “advertisement” to appear near native ads that it deems could create confusion if consumers cannot discern quickly and simply that what they are viewing is a paid ad.

The FTC guidelines frown on the popular catch phrases such as “promoted by” or “sponsored by” that many publishers have favored when describing a native ad on their sites.

Basically, a native ad is content paid for by an advertiser but made to look very much like the journalistically generated content that publishers produce in digital format, but at times in print and even video games. The FTC said the primary guideline must be to avoid deceiving consumers.

“Advertisers should not use terms such as ‘Promoted’ or ‘Promoted Stories,’ which in this context are at best ambiguous and potentially could mislead consumers that advertising content is endorsed by a publisher site,” the FTC said in its guidelines released Dec. 22.

There are several other words that the FTC does not like.

“Depending on the context, consumers reasonably may interpret other terms such as ‘Presented by [X],’ ‘Brought to you by [X],’ ‘Promoted by [X]’ or ‘Sponsored by [X]’ to mean that a sponsoring advertiser funded or ‘underwrote’ but did not create or influence the content.”

The Interactive Advertising Bureau applauded some aspects of the new guidelines but said it has “concerns” that the FTC employed “granular dictating of word choice,” according to Brad Weltman, vice president of public policy at the IAB.

The FTC does allow a fair amount of leniency in other areas.

For instance, it does not automatically reject ads that have the same look and feel of the content, so long as consumers would not be deceived. It points to a hypothetical running-shoe manufacturer whose native ad could appear on a financial news site without requiring disclosures, since consumers were not likely to be confused into thinking the shoe information is connected to the financial editorial.

Other areas could get a pass as well. “Native ads can also be integrated into content including entertainment programming and video games,” the FTC said.

“In some instances, consumers are likely to understand that a sponsoring advertiser paid for the product integration. In other instances, a disclosure may be necessary to avoid deceiving consumers.”

No penalties for violating the guidelines were disclosed — so far.

Joe Mohen, the ex-CEO of Nylon Media who has bought and sold a number of digital operations, said he predicted that the FTC would only follow up with “spot enforcement of the most egregious violations.”

“I could see more enforcement in the area of pharmaceutical ads, where misuse of that could have a highly negative impact,” Mohen said. “But for other publishers in fashion, beauty or entertainment, there is not much of a Chinese wall to begin with.”","Nearly two years after its first public hearings on the matter, the Federal Trade Commission finally weighed in with new native advertising guidelines for print and digital publishers.

19,"Before making your final presidential candidate pick, be aware that it can have a direct impact on your wallet.

In the International Business Times, personal finance editor Lauren Lyons Cole explains how the tax plans of leading presidential candidates could have a ""lasting impact on the American economy as well as your future paycheck,"" based on research from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Perhaps the most surprising finding from Cole's research was that Donald Trump would put the most money back into your paycheck. The GOP front-runner proposes tax cuts across all income levels, and slashing taxes for those making up to $50,000.

""With Trump, of course, it's going to benefit the wealthy the most, so as you go up, your paycheck will increase drastically, which would benefit him as well,"" Cole explained on ""CBS This Morning"" Friday.

But this comes at a cost -- a $9.5 trillion federal deficit over the next decade, which would require drastic reductions in federal spending to help pay for the tax breaks.

Republican rival Ted Cruz's tax plan would also result in an enormous federal deficit: an estimated $8.6 trillion over the next decade. Cruz's plan is the ""most creative,"" Cole said, and would reform the current 750,000-page tax code for a flat tax rate of 10 percent across all incomes.

Cruz's plan would also benefit the wealthy most, even more so than Trump's, Cole said. As for the middle class, paychecks may increase by about 50 dollars, according to the International Business Times analysis.

On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders would also raise the federal deficit with his tax plan, which Cole said was ""more extreme"" than Trump's. The senator vows to raise taxes regardless of your income, with the highest earners paying over 40 percent, for a ""trade off"" for funding free government programs, including college and health care.

""Unless you need health care, then Bernie Sanders is not going to do a lot for you,"" Cole said.

But if you want to keep things as they are, Cole said Clinton is your choice. Most Americans can expect the same taxes, and only those making over one million dollars would face an increase. For those making $5 million and over, Clinton plans to add a four percent surtax.

""Hillary Clinton is very status quo. Her plan is very similar to what we have with President Obama,"" Cole said.

20,"The man behind the Bastille Day truck attack that killed at least 84 people in Nice had recently been radicalised, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls says.

Thursday night's attack in the Riviera city of Nice plunged France into new grief and fear just eight months after gunmen killed 130 people in Paris. Those attacks, and one in Brussels four months ago, shocked Western Europe, already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration, open borders and pockets of Islamist radicalism.

Authorities are yet to produce evidence 31-year-old Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, shot dead by police, had any links to Islamic State, which claimed the attack, but Valls said there was no doubt on the assailant's motives.

""The investigation will establish the facts, but we know now that the killer was radicalised very quickly,"" Valls said in an interview with Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche.

""The claim on Saturday morning by Islamic State and the fast radicalisation of the killer confirms the Islamist nature of this attack.""

Officials said on Saturday that people questioned by police had indicated that he had undergone a rapid transformation from someone with no apparent interest in religion.

Relatives and friends interviewed in Nice painted a picture of a man who at least until recently drank alcohol, smoked marijuana and according to French media even ate pork, behaviour that would be unlikely in a devout Muslim.

Speaking from his home town in Tunisia, Bouhlel's sister told Reuters he had been having psychological problems when he left for France in 2005 and had sought medical treatment.

As authorities were trying to better understand his motives, two more people, a man and a woman close to Bouhlel, were arrested in Nice early on Sunday, bringing the number of people in detention over the killings to seven.

The Amaq news agency affiliated with the militant Islamist group said that Bouhlel ""was one of the soldiers of Islamic State"".

Valls, who said security services had prevented 16 attacks over three years, indicated that at play on Thursday was the group's modus operandi of cajoling unstable individuals into carrying out attacks with whatever means possible.

""Daesh gives unstable individuals an ideological kit that allows them to make sense of their acts ... this is probably what happened in Nice's case,"" Valls said, referring to the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

The group, which is under military pressure from forces opposed to it, considers France its main target given its military operations in the Middle East, and also because it is easier to strike than the United States, which is leading a coalition against it.

Despite mounting criticism from the conservative opposition and far right over how President Francois Hollande's Socialist government is handling security, Valls said there was no risk zero and new attacks would occur.

""I've always said the truth regarding terrorism: there is an ongoing war, there will be more attacks. It's difficult to say, but other lives will be lost.""

With presidential and parliamentary elections less than a year away, French opposition politicians are increasing pressure and seizing on what they described as security failings that made it possible for the truck to career 2km through large crowds before it was finally halted.

After Thursday's attack, a state of emergency imposed across France after the November attacks in Paris was extended by three months.","The family of the man who killed 84 people in Nice doubt his Islamic State links, but French authorities say he may have been radicalised very quickly.","Generated Summary: The man behind the Bastille Day truck attack that killed at least 84 people in Nice had recently been radicalised, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls says."

25,"TEMPE, Ariz. -- David Johnson's NFL career is only 28 games old, and already he is being compared to some of the great running backs of the game.

Statistics bear those comparisons out, and his performance in the Arizona Cardinals' 31-23 victory over Washington on Sunday did nothing to diminish such talk.

Johnson's multi-purpose skills were on full display when he rushed 18 times for 84 yards and a touchdown and caught nine passes for 91 yards and a score.

With those statistics, the second-year player and third-round pick out of Northern Iowa, became the second player in NFL history to top 100 yards per game in the first 12 games of a season. Hall of Famer Edgerrin James did it in a record 13 games to start the 2005 season.

Johnson joins another Hall of Famer, Marshall Faulk, as the only players to have 1,000 yards rushing and 700 yards receiving through 12 games.

Faulk did it in 1998, scoring six touchdowns in the process. Johnson has an NFL-leading 15 TDs.

Arizona coach Bruce Arians was an assistant coach at Indianapolis when first Faulk, then James were there.

Johnson, Arians said, ""reminds me a lot of those guys.""

The lofty comparisons are nothing new to the quiet Johnson.

""It's a great achievement just to hear that,"" he said. ""to be talked about amongst those great players.""

Johnson mostly just smiles on the field when he's doing his damage. There's no chest-thumping over his success.

""I think it's the past, growing up, not getting looked at (by big colleges),"" he said of his humility, ""still not getting looked at going into the pros. I think those are the main things. Also, I'm a Christian and reading the Bible and God is letting me know to be humble amongst men.""

Johnson caught a 25-yard touchdown pass and scored on a one-yard run against the Redskins, but it was a play late in the game that was most crucial.

Late in the fourth quarter and leading 24-23, the Cardinals had the ball fourth-and-one at their own 34-yard line and Arians called for one of his characteristic gambles, going for it.

Arizona went with its bread-and-butter play, giving the ball to Johnson behind left tackle D.J. Humphries.

Johnson ripped off a 14-yard gain and, moments later, Carson Palmer threw a 42-yard touchdown pass to J.J. Nelson to make it an eight-point game

""He's going to make you right most of the time,"" Humphries said of his young running back. ""He was really just supposed to cram that for a yard. We only needed a yard. He saw a little seam right there and said `Let me hit that.'""

After the game, Palmer called Johnson ""the best player in the NFL -- point blank.""

""I think he's proven that,"" Palmer said. ""Our wins and losses have affected some of the hype that he has not gotten and other guys have gotten because they are on winning teams. He's the best player in the NFL.""

Larry Fitzgerald called the fourth-and-one play ""a gutsy call that I knew coach would make.""

""I mean, what do we have to lose at this point,"" Fitzgerald said. "". ... I just knew that getting the ball in the -- I think the National Football League's MVP in David Johnson -- getting the ball in his hands and let him do what he does. He delivered as he always does.""

Johnson wasn't the only one mentioned among the game's greats after Sunday's contest.

With his 10 catches and 78 yards, Fitzgerald moved past Cris Carter and Marvin Harrison into third on the NFL's career receptions list (1,106). He has caught a pass in 191 consecutive games, third-longest streak in league history.

Fitzgerald also became the youngest player to reach 1,100 receptions -- from 16 different quarterbacks.

27,"Walpole Old Chapel, Suffolk. Christopher Stell wrote despairingly to its trustees when they were planning to sell it. Photograph: Historic Chapels Trust

Christopher Stell, who has died aged 84 from kidney failure, was recently described as the ""doyen of nonconformist architectural historians"". His reputation in this field was established by his weighty four-volume Inventory of Nonconformist Chapels and Meeting Houses in England that appeared between 1986 and 2002.

The architecture of religious dissent in England is sometimes modest and deliberately self-effacing, especially those places of worship built by the Quakers and the earlier Congregational and Unitarian groups. But from the 19th century nonconformity often produced well-appointed buildings, proud to assert differences from established religion in their architecture. All seek to bear testimony to centuries of religious diversity in England since nonconformist worship was first made conditionally lawful in 1689. Yet architectural (and other) historians have been slow to catch up and, until Stell's inventory, too often ignored the majority of places of worship in Britain – that is, those that are not Anglican.

In particular, Stell's work highlighted the many serious omissions in the Pevsner Architectural Guides of that time, with the inventory itself becoming a ""Pevsner for nonconformism"". Like his predecessor, Stell visited each site by car. Unlike Nikolaus Pevsner, he drove himself and also recorded the buildings with photographs, careful scale drawings and sometimes sketches. It was a marathon task and his family became used to his absence throughout the week.

It is a testimony to his work that the revised Buildings of England volumes of today do list and discuss nonconformist places of worship with far greater seriousness.

Stell was born and brought up in Liverpool, the son of a PE teacher, and read architecture at Liverpool University's School of Architecture. Completing his training, he resolved to be a building historian and early writing quickly established his credentials as an accomplished self-taught researcher.

So many chapels and meeting houses have been demolished since the second world war, especially in those working-class communities where the once thriving ""co-op and chapel culture"" has collapsed in recent decades. Their entry in his inventory has become their obituary. Many have been converted to other uses which at least preserves the chapel outlines in the English landscape; but the photos in the inventory poignantly show the lost interiors.

In 1988 Stell helped found the Chapels Society which has pioneered serious study of this neglected area. When he heard that Walpole Old Chapel in Suffolk was to be sold off he wrote to its trustees: ""It truly amazes me that any denomination should wish to dispose itself of one of the finest and oldest and most richly evocative buildings in its care. To dispose of a worn-out building is one thing. To disclaim any further interest in the one tangible link with early Suffolk Independency is another.""

In fact the church did divest itself of this simple but moving building though happily it went to the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, of which Stell was also a founding spirit and trustee for two decades.

Stell was trustee of the Ancient Monuments Society for 30 years and attended every one of the annual Vernacular Architecture Group meeting for 50 years. He personally rescued a partly 17th-century stone house in Calderdale intended for demolition, which he bought for £50. He got it listed and adapted it with the absolute minimum of modernisation, long before such a domestic style became fashionable.

Always modest but meticulous in his scholarship, he quietly appreciated the recognition of an OBE in 1989 and the fact that his work was the first port of call for younger scholars. A lifelong Baptist, he enjoyed the Athenaeum – traditionally better known for the Anglican bishops among its members – for Stell was a champion of religious dissent who felt confident in the corridors of power.

Many will remember his astonishing recall for buildings he had last seen 20 or 30 years previously, his endless curiosity and his dapper hats. Sometimes he wore a brown bowler, sometimes a deerstalker – for he loved Conan Doyle stories, as only a meticulous detective of buildings would.

He is survived by his wife, Jean, whom he married in 1957, and their sons, John and Edward.

30,"Ronald Reagan apologized to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for invading Grenada in 1983 without consulting her, according to a newly published conversation between the world leaders.

“I’m sorry for any embarrassment that we caused you,” the former President said, “but please understand that it was just our fear of our own weakness over here with regard to secrecy.” In October 1983, Reagan ordered U.S. troops to invade Grenada, a Caribbean island nation, after he determined that its turbulent Marxist government posed a threat to the almost 1,000 Americans on the island (many of whom were students at a medical school). Grenada had been troubling the Reagan administration ever since its Constitution was suspended after a coup in 1979, and the new government began to cozy up to Communist Cuba.

The American invasion of Grenada was very unpopular in Britain, as Grenada was a Commonwealth nation.

“If I were there Margaret, I’d throw my hat in the door before I came in,” Reagan said, which the BBC recalled was an old tradition that allowed an unwelcome guest to announce their arrival before they entered a room. The full transcript of the phone conversation is available on the Margaret Thatcher Foundation’s website.

While Thatcher wasn’t exactly forgiving, she did say she understood where Reagan was coming from. “I know about sensitivity, because of the Falklands. That’s why I would not speak for very long even on the secret telephone to you. Because even that can be broken. I’m very much aware of sensitivities,” she said. “The action is underway now and we just hope it will be successful.”

The conversation ended on good terms, though, with Thatcher getting off the phone to go to a “tricky” Parliament debate, and Reagan encouraging her to “Go get ’em. Eat ’em alive.”

The tapes, released to the public in October at the Reagan Library in Los Angeles, prove that Reagan continued the long Presidential tradition of recording phone conversations in the White House situation room, even after the debacle with former President Richard Nixon years earlier. It’s also a classic example of an age-old trick: ask forgiveness, not permission.",According to newly released tapes of phone calls between the leaders,"Generated Summary: Ronald Reagan apologized to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for invading Grenada in 1983 without consulting her, according to a newly published conversation between the world leaders."

That’s what a jury in San Diego told Anna Alaburda a graduate of the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, who left school with roughly $150,000 in debt but says she was unable to find employment as a lawyer.

According to a report in the New York Times, “Alaburda argued that the school reported a higher percentage of its graduates landed jobs after graduation than was actually the case, and that she relied on the bogus data to choose to attend the school.” The jury disagreed that the school should be held liable.

Alaburda is one of many law school graduates across the country who have tried to sue their former schools for publishing what they argue were misleading statistics on graduates chances for high-paying employment after graduation, but the Alaburda case is rare in that it actually made it in front of a jury without being thrown out or settled.

Alaburda relied on California State anti-fraud statutes to argue that the school mislead her into believing that 80 percent of its graduates found employment as lawyers nine months after graduation. In fact, those statistics included graduates who found “such work as a pool cleaner, waitress or sales clerk,” according to the report.

32,"Treasurer Joe Hockey has urged first home buyers to get “a good job that pays good money” if they want to enter the property market.

When asked at a press conference on Tuesday if residential property in Australia’s biggest city was out of the reach of many, Hockey said: “If housing were unaffordable in Sydney, no one would be buying it.”

Related: Sydney and parts of Melbourne are 'unequivocally' in a house price bubble

“The starting point for first home buyers is to get a good job that pays good money,” he added.

The comments were slammed on social media, with many users criticising the treasurer for being simplistic and out of touch with the difficulties Generation Y faces in enter the property market.

Mr Hockey, next time you're in hospital getting seen to by a nurse, are you going to insist that s/he gets a job that pays good money?

Opposition leader Bill Shorten was scathing of the treasurer’s comments.

“What planet is Joe Hockey living on?” Shorten asked. “This isn’t just another Joe Hockey gaffe; this is proof he just doesn’t get the pressures families are facing.”

Joe Hockey must be the only person in Australia who doesn’t think housing affordability is an issue. As far as he’s concerned, if Joe Hockey’s doing OK then everyone else is too,” Shorten said.

“How are Australians supposed to find the ‘good jobs that pay more’ when unemployment is at its highest levels in more than a decade under his government?”

Greens leader Richard Di Natale labelled the treasurer’s comments “fantasy land stuff” from a man charged with the “nation’s purse strings”.

“That’s right out there, that sort of language, that’s let them eat cake sort of stuff,” Di Natale told reporters in Melbourne. “Go and get a job that pays more money? We are just going to magic these jobs up out of thin air?”

Hockey continued to deny that parts of Australia were experiencing a housing bubble, saying that housing affordability would become easier as supply increased.

“I say again in relation to what is reasonably expensive entry costs for first home buyers into housing in Australia, the best response is to build more housing,” he said, adding that there is a greater role for both state and local governments in accelerating the building process.

The comments come just days after the treasury secretary, John Fraser, warned that parts of Sydney and Melbourne are experiencing a housing bubble, and the head of the financial systems inquiry, David Murray, said a sharp fall in property prices could be detrimental to the economy.

In August, Hockey came under fire for being out of touch after suggesting Australia’s “poorest people either don’t have cars or actually don’t drive very far in many cases”.

The treasurer admitted on Tuesday that measures to restore integrity in foreign investment would not result in a drop in residential prices.

The Foreign Investment Review Board is investigating nearly 200 cases of suspected unlawful purchases of property. Foreign investors can buy new property in Australia, but must seek approval before purchasing existing residential property. Temporary residents who buy property must sell it when they leave the country.

“I am not suggesting this is going to represent thousands and thousands of homes. But what it is going to do is provide reassurance that people are complying with the law when they engage in the purchase of a property,” Hockey said. “We welcome foreign investment in new real estate because it adds to the stock.”

A new set penalties for foreign investors who buy existing stock will come into play from 1 December. The government wants members to dob in suspicious foreign property owners via a new telephone hotline. Concerned citizens can call the hotline on 1800 050 377.

But Hockey warned against racially profiling investors.

“They may look like foreign buyers, but they’re not,” he said, pointing to the fact that some Chinese families have been in Australia longer than his own family.","Asked whether Sydney’s property prices are out of reach for many, the treasurer responded: ‘If housing were unaffordable in Sydney, no one would be buying it’",Generated Summary: Treasurer Joe HockeyTreasurer Joe Hockey has urged first home buyers to get 'a good job that pays good money' if they want to enter the property market.
33,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Monday it would investigate a crash that killed Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin in his recalled 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

Yelchin was killed when the SUV rolled away and pinned him against a fence in Los Angeles, police said on Sunday. Fiat Chrysler in April recalled more than 1.1 million cars and SUVs worldwide because vehicles may roll away after drivers exit, an issue linked to 41 injuries, 212 crashes, and 308 reports of property damage, though it had no immediate fix for owners.

In a May 24 letter to dealers, Fiat Chrysler fcau said it anticipated having the software updates required to fix the vehicles no later than July or August. The company previously had told owners it hoped to come up with a “permanent” remedy by the fourth quarter.

Fiat Chrysler spokesman Eric Mayne said the company would conduct a “thorough investigation” of Yelchin’s accident. “It is premature to speculate on its cause at this time,” he added.

Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Jane Kim said by phone on Monday that investigators were aware of the recall issue with the Jeep and were looking at whether that played any role in the fatality.

Yelchin, a 27-year-old Russian native, would be the first death reported to be linked to the defect. In 2014, a U.S. study said nearly 100 people were killed and 2,000 injured annually from vehicles that rolled away between 2008 and 2011.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Fiat Chrysler said in April that the recall was linked to 700 incidents because drivers mistakenly believed they had placed the vehicles in park before exiting.

Fiat Chrysler said some drivers might have been confused by the electronic gearshift system, which moves more like a joystick than along a gate path like conventional gear selectors.

The company said in April that it planned to update the vehicles to automatically prevent them from moving, under certain circumstances, even if the driver fails to put the vehicle in park.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which upgraded a probe into the rollaway injuries and complaints in February, said in April that the shifter was “clearly a safety issue” leading to hundreds of crashes and dozens of injuries.

A NHTSA spokeswoman had no immediate comment on Monday.

Fiat Chrysler sent a letter to vehicle owners after announcing the recall in April, warning them to make sure the vehicles are in park.

NHTSA said in April that testing of the shifter found it was “not intuitive and provides poor tactile and visual feedback to the driver, increasing the potential for unintended gear selection.”

Yelchin’s death comes a month before the release of Star Trek Beyond, in which the late actor played Chekov, the young Russian navigator of the starship, USS Enterprise.

Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box office tracker comScore, said the actor’s death is unlikely to impact the film’s performance at the box office.

“It doesn’t turn people away but it is bittersweet and poignant when that actor appears on screen,” Dergarabedian said. “He was so likable on screen, particularly as that character.”

The cast and creators of Star Trek Beyond paid tribute to Yelchin on Sunday, with producer J.J. Abrams posting on Twitter, “You were brilliant. You were funny as hell, and supremely talented. And you weren’t here nearly long enough.”

Viacom’s Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the Star Trek franchise, said in a statement on Monday, “All of us at Paramount join the world in mourning the untimely passing of Anton Yelchin. As a member of the Star Trek family, he was beloved by so many and he will missed by all.”

The studio viab did not comment on whether more Star Trek films are scheduled for the future.

Yelchin has appeared in numerous films and was in the TV series Huff, starring Hank Azaria, who wrote on Twitter that he was devastated. “He was a very sweet kid. My heart goes out to his family.”

37,"Diamonds are forever - but they're not for every bride.

Don't look for a rock on Akilla Bando's finger. When this 26-year-old administrative assistant from Mount Vernon got engaged last year, she received a sparkly, pink tourmaline ring from her fiancé, Jefferson Holly.

The 27-year-old electronics specialist at Target paid about $2,500 for his token of love. A diamond ring of the same size would have cost at least double that, but saving money wasn't the only consideration.

""He knows I'm into non-traditional styles,"" Bando explained. ""I'm kind of spunky. I wanted something different.""

For most brides, there is no more meaningful symbol of enduring love then a gleaming diamond set in platinum or gold. Diamond engagement ring sales rose 8% last year to $6.2 billion, with 75% of brides opting for ice, according to the Diamond Information Center.

But for some - especially older, more independent-minded wives-to-be - the traditional diamond engagement can be as passe as the dowry and trousseau.

For years, the most popular diamond alternatives have been rings with precious colored gemstones, a fad fueled when Princess Diana marked her betrothal with a blue sapphire.

Celebs like J. Lo - remember her pink diamond engagement ring from Ben Affleck? - and Heidi Klum - she went for a 10-carat yellow diamond - have kept the color trend rolling.

""The new couple wants something else, they want color in their lives,"" said Tony Platyan, owner of Pico Jewelry, a jewelry store on 47th Street that specializes in sapphires, rubies and emeralds.

Playtan said sales in his shop have jumped 25% over the last five years. The customer going for color ""is a slightly older woman,"" he said. Sometimes it's her second marriage and ""she has a diamond already."" But these precious gems ""are not necessarily cheaper"" than diamonds, said Antoinette Matlins, author of ""Diamonds.""

If you're looking to save, think about birthstones, such as garnet, aquamarine or tourmaline. Can't afford an emerald ring for your honey? Try a green tsavorite garnet ring at one tenth the price.

Other alternatives to the traditional engagement ring include bands with tiny diamonds that can sometimes look like wedding rings, or vintage-inspired rings.

Some couples are skipping the ring tradition altogether because they see better uses for their hard-earned dollars.

""I hear modern brides saying, 'I don't want the engagement ring. I want the house,' "" said Kathleen Murray, deputy editor of The Knot.

Others skirt tradition to avoid so-called conflict diamonds. If you want a diamond but are wary about its origin, ask your jeweler for a certificate verifying that the stone originated from a conflict-free zone.

Joanna Ouellette, a 30-year-old bride from Forest Hills, Queens, who works at a small book publisher, never considered a diamond engagement ring when beau Josh Chaplin, 30, a database consultant, popped the question.

""I actually had my grandmother's engagement ring. It's very pretty, but it's not me,"" said Ouellette, who doesn't wear much jewelry.

When Chaplin proposed, he handed his sweetheart a very small diamond set into a curved, matte-finish band.

""Josh paid $500, a cheapy, that's fine,"" Ouellette said. ""My mother was like, 'That's so tiny!' I was like, 'Thanks so much!' I don't care if it cost $500 or five grand.

40,"A pregnant woman in Britain has had her unborn baby forcibly removed by caesarean section and put up for adoption by social services.

Social services workers for Essex County Council obtained a court order to sedate the woman and take her baby in July last year because she had suffered a mental breakdown.

The woman, who is unnamed for legal reasons, is an Italian who had travelled to Britain at the time for a training course with an airline.

She reportedly had a panic attack after failing to take medication for a pre-existing bipolar condition.

The woman called police, who took her to a psychiatric hospital and sectioned her under Britain's mental health laws.

The baby was forcibly removed by caesarean five weeks later and the mother was returned to Italy.

The baby girl, now 15 months old, is still in the care of British social services.

They are refusing to give her back to the mother, despite her claims she has fully recovered.

A Chelmsford Crown Court in February ruled the baby should instead be placed up for adoption due to the risk the mother could suffer a relapse.

""I can understand if someone is very ill that they may not be able to consent to a medical procedure, but a forced caesarean is unprecedented,"" the woman's British lawyer, Brendan Flemind, told the UK’s Telegraph.

""If there were concerns about the care of this child by an Italian mother, then the better plan would have been for the authorities here to have notified social services in Italy and for the child to have been taken back there.""

43,"Edward Snowden has condemned Australian law enforcement for collecting the communications records of a Guardian journalist without a warrant.

The world’s most prominent whistleblower, who disclosed dragnet surveillance unprecedented in its scale by the National Security Agency and its allies, singled out for critique the Australian government’s contention that it broke no laws in its leak investigation of Paul Farrell, a Guardian reporter who in 2014 exposed the inner workings of Australia’s maritime interception of asylum seekers.

Related: Australia's attacks on journalists' sources are about politics, not national security

“Police in developed democracies don’t pore over journalists’ private activities to hunt down confidential sources,” Snowden told the Guardian.

“The Australian federal police are defending such operations as perfectly legal, but that’s really the problem, isn’t it? Sometimes the scandal is not what law was broken, but what the law allows.”

Throughout 2015 the Australian parliament enacted a series of controversial laws that curbed privacy and freedom of expression rights.

Geoffrey King, director of the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Technology Program, said the AFP’s actions were “obviously outrageous”.

“This should not be happening. But it is the inevitable result of mandatory data retention and mass surveillance, which is neither necessary nor proportional to any threat,” King said. “It doesn’t line up with the values that we all adhere to, to good counter-terrorism strategy, and it certainly doesn’t line up with a free and open society where journalists can do their jobs.”

In March 2015 the Australian Senate passed legislation requiring internet and mobile phone companies to retain customer metadata for 24 months. The bill was vehemently opposed by the Australian Greens, whose communications spokesman, Senator Scott Ludlam, called its new provisions a “form of mass surveillance”.

Although a last-minute amendment obliged security agencies to get a warrant before accessing a journalist’s metadata, the law essentially expands the Australian government’s ability to conduct dragnet surveillance.

Australia, along with the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, is part of the Five Eyes signals-intelligence sharing network.

Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that Australian spying authorities had offered to share bulk metadata of ordinary Australian citizens with their partners in the Five Eyes network. Other documents Snowden leaked revealed Australian spies had attempted to listen in to the phone calls of former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his inner circle, causing an extended diplomatic rift between the two countries.

The investigation into Farrell’s sources, for a story relating to the activities of an Australian customs vessel and a controversial operation to turn back a boat carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia, was conducted in 2014, before the amendment passed parliament. Law enforcement did not need a warrant for accessing the information at the time.

The case marks the first time the AFP has confirmed seeking access to a journalist’s metadata in a specific case, although the agency has admitted to investigating several journalists reporting on Australian immigration.

The acknowledgement that authorities had sought access to Farrell’s records was only divulged after the reporter lodged a complaint with Australia’s privacy commissioner under the country’s Privacy Act.

44,"For the first time, Accenture on Monday released a detailed breakdown of the gender and ethnicity of its U.S. workforce.

While many tech companies have started publishing their employee diversity stats in the past year or so, the practice remains extremely rare in other industries — including consulting. Neither PwC, Deloitte, EY, nor Bain and Co. reveal their diversity numbers in this level of detail. What’s more, IBM, another major Accenture competitor, is one of the few tech giants that still refuses to release its stats.

“We already spend a lot of time and money and focus [on increasing diversity], and yet we’re not making the progress that we want to, so we feel like we need to be disruptive,” says Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, North America, on the company’s decision to publish the data.

The release reveals that women account for about 36% of the company’s total U.S. workforce.

Accenture, which is No. 98 on Fortune‘s 100 Best Companies to Work For list, is roughly half white and a third Asian. Black employees make up 7.4% of the company’s workforce, while Hispanic or Latino employees hold 6.3% of jobs.

Women lose some ground at the company’s upper level, accounting for 31% of executives.

The executive ranks are also notably less diverse, with black and Hispanic employees accounting for just 4.4% and 3.7% of top jobs, respectively.

In addition, Accenture revealed that it currently employs 1,450 people who self-identify as persons with disabilities and 1,000 veterans. (The company has pledged to hire an additional 5,000 vets or spouses of vets by 2020.)

Accenture has committed to releasing updated diversity numbers each year. Although it did not lay out specific goals for 2016, Sweet is clear that she expects the company to make gains over last year’s stats: “We think we can do more.”

Making the numbers public will hold the company accountable for showing improvement, she says. What’s more, Sweet hopes that this new level of transparency will allow Accenture to have more explicit, productive discussions about race and gender internally.

To help speed the pace of change, the company also announced that it is starting a new referral program that will reward employees who refer women, black, Hispanic, and veteran candidates who end up getting hired. This comes on the heels of a slate of new parent-friendly policies announced last year, including 16 paid weeks of maternity leave and an option for new parents to work locally for one year after the birth of their child.

“When I took my new role as chief executive of North America, I had this realization that with 48,000 and a $14 billion business I had a real opportunity to make change — and I feel a deep sense of responsibility,” Sweet says. “I personally feel I will have failed if I do not make progress toward making us the most inclusive and diverse workforce in the U.S.”","The company's U.S. workforce is half white, a third women.","Generated Summary: For the first time, Accenture on Monday released a detailed breakdown of the gender and ethnicity of its U.S. workforce."

46,"Starbucks doesn’t offer bank accounts, but people are storing more of their money with the coffee chain than they are at some banks, according to a new analysis.

As more customers join the company’s loyalty rewards program—it now has 12 million members—they are paying for their coffee using the Starbucks sbux cards or its mobile app, which now have a total $1.2 billion loaded onto them for future lattes or snack purchases, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of “Where Money Lives.”

That’s more than many banks have in deposits, including First Commonwealth Financial Corp. fcf and Charles Schwab schw , according to the data, which came from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Still, Starbucks is holding far less of customers’ money than larger banks and financial institutions such as Bank of America bac , the leader in deposits with more than $427 billion, Wells Fargo wfc ($67.8 billion in deposits) and American Express axp (which has $3.3 billion in customers’ funds loaded onto prepaid debit cards). Even PayPal pypl , which is making a major push into digital payments, now has more than $13 billion parked in its accounts, MarketWatch points out in its own analysis.

But the money banked at Starbucks appears to be growing rapidly, with the current $1.2 billion nearly double the $621 million the company had in 2014, according to Bloomberg. That growth has been fueled by the company’s popular app: Starbucks has “one of the most successful mobile wallets,” Leena Rao writes in the new issue of Fortune.

47,"CHICAGO, Dec. 7— Researchers have confirmed that a baby can ingest cocaine through breast milk, a Northwestern University pediatrician said Sunday.

The study by Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff, published in the December issue of the Journal of Pediatrics, is being used by the authorities investigating the death of a baby in Detroit in July.

Dr. Chasnoff, chief of Northwestern's Perinatal Center for Chemical Dependence, said he was approached by Wayne County, Mich., authorities because of his research.

''They said they had a child who had died and during a routine autopsy found high levels of cocaine,'' Dr. Chasnoff said. ''They talked to the mother and found she had used crack, which is a pure form of cocaine. They asked me if I had any information.'' No Decision on Charges

The authorities in Detroit told The Detroit Free Press that the infant's 18-year-old mother had nursed her baby after smoking crack, a pure form of cocaine. They said the baby died two days later.

While he said he was not familiar with details in the Detroit case, Dr. Chasnoff said it was in line with his own findings: ''that there can be severe damage, even death, if the baby gets a high enough dosage of cocaine.''

Dr. Chasnoff's study details the case of a 2-week-old Illinois infant girl whose mother was breast-feeding while she sniffed cocaine. Within three hours after the mother used about half a gram of cocaine, the child became ''markedly irritable and began vomiting and having diarrhea,'' the report said.

The mother noted that the baby's pupils were dilated and became worried when the baby's eyes would not focus on her face, Dr. Chasnoff said. The child was brought to a hospital emergency room a few hours later.

After about two and a half days, doctors were able to clear the cocaine from the child's urinary tract, the researchers said. The case was reported to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, which recommended that the infant be sent home with the parents under court supervision.

''Once the cocaine was cleared from her system, she continued to do well,'' Dr. Chasnoff said.

He said the infant ''demonstrated the clinical manifestations of cocaine intoxication, following ingestion of the mother's milk.'' Rapid Cross-Over

''The study documents for the first time that cocaine does cross over into breast milk, and that it does remain present for more than 36 hours,'' he said. ''And it looks like it crosses over fairly rapidly.''

In the Detroit case, Dr. L.J. Dragovic, assistant county medical examiner, said he believed the cocaine ingested in the mother's milk triggered a chain of events, including dehydration, that lead to death.

Dr. Dragovic said that the death was the first of its kind he had heard of, adding, ''and I've looked through all the medical literature I could find.''

Richard Padzieski, chief of operations for the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, said investigators were waiting for a copy of Dr. Chasnoff's report before deciding whether to charge the mother. ''Whether it's going to impact on the decision, I can't tell you,'' he said.","LEAD: Researchers have confirmed that a baby can ingest cocaine through breast milk, a Northwestern University pediatrician said Sunday.","Generated Summary: CHICAGO, Dec. 7 -- Researchers have confirmed that a baby can ingest cocaine through breast milk, a Northwestern University pediatrician said Sunday."

The former Secretary of State is ahead of Trump by 46% to 33% among likely voters, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll shows. Another 21% did not support either candidate.

The poll, which surveyed 1,146 likely voters in the country between July 8 and July 12, also found that half of likely voters now say they have a favorable view of Clinton. That’s compared to the roughly 60% of people polled who say they have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to Reuters.

50,"NEW YORK — Twitter said Thursday it has suspended 360,000 accounts since mid-2015 for violating its policies banning the promotion of terrorism and violent extremism.

The San Francisco-based company said in a blog post that it has also made progress in preventing users who were suspended from immediately returning to the platform using different accounts, which has been a problem in the past.

It said its rate of daily suspensions is up 80 percent since last year, though it did not provide specific numbers. The suspensions spike immediately following terrorist attacks, it said.

Twitter noted that there is no magic formula for identifying extremist accounts. Like other social media companies, it uses a variety of tools — including spam-fighting technology, automatic identification, and reports from users — to help combat abuse.

The report on its efforts comes after Twitter had been criticized for not doing enough to keep extremist groups like Islamic State from using the short-messaging service to crowdsource supporters and potential attackers.

Last week, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Twitter that accused the company of supporting Islamic State by allowing it to sign up for and use Twitter accounts.

The judge agreed with Twitter that the company cannot be held liable because federal law protects service providers that merely offer platforms for speech, without creating the speech itself.

At the same time, Twitter stressed that it was working to combat violent extremism on its service.","Twitter said Thursday it has suspended 360,000 accounts for violating its policies banning the promotion of terrorism.","Generated Summary: NEW YORK -- Twitter said Thursday it has suspended 360,000 accounts since mid-2015 for violating its policies banning the promotion of terrorism and violent extremism."

52,"Suicide bombers driving ambulances packed with explosives detonated their vehicles at a checkpoint and a car park for Shi'ite pilgrims in two Iraqi cities, killing at least 21 people and wounding dozens.

The twin attacks took place on Sunday in Tikrit and Samarra, as Iraqi troops and security forces battled to retake the northern city of Mosul from Islamic State militants who have controlled it for more than two years.

They appeared to be part of a series of diversionary attacks by the ultra-hardline Sunni Islamists, who have struck the Kurdish-controlled city of Kirkuk, the capital Baghdad and a western desert town during the three-week Mosul campaign.

In Tikrit, a bomber detonated his explosives-laden ambulance at the southern entrance to the city during the morning rush hour, killing 13 people, police and hospital sources said.

Another attacker detonated a vehicle in a car park for pilgrims visiting one of Shi'ite Islam's holiest shrines, al-Askari mosque in Samarra, south of Tikrit.

The bomb killed at least eight people, local officials said, including two Iranian pilgrims.

The local operation command, a joint military and police unit, said the vehicle used in Samarra was also an ambulance.

Authorities in both cities declared curfews, fearing possible further attacks.

53,"AN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 - Google Inc. plans to announce on Thursday that it is adding a new search service aimed at scientists and academic researchers.

Google Scholar, which was scheduled to go online Wednesday evening at scholar.google.com, is a result of the company's collaboration with a number of scientific and academic publishers and is intended as a first stop for researchers looking for scholarly literature like peer-reviewed papers, books, abstracts and technical reports.

Google executives declined to say how many additional documents and books had been indexed and made searchable through the service. While the great majority of recent scholarly papers and periodicals are indexed on the Web, many have not been easily accessible to the public.

The engineer who led the project, Anurag Acharya, said the company had received broad cooperation from academic, scientific and technical publishers like the Association of Computing Machinery, Nature, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Online Computer Library Center.

The new Google service, which includes a listing of scientific citations as well as ways to find materials at libraries that are not online, will not initially include the text advertisements that are shown on standard pages for Google search results.

However, company executives say it is likely that advertisements will eventually accompany search results on Google Scholar. One academic publishing executive, John Sack, director of HighWire Press at Stanford University, said that such advertising could be quite profitable.

""The commercial reason for doing this is that you can target areas with high-quality, high-payback ads,"" Mr. Sack said. ""An advertisement that goes next to an article on cloning techniques is probably going to be for services that are pretty expensive.""

Mr. Acharya, who started the Google Scholar project, said his motivation, in part, had been a desire to help the academic community from which Google emerged.

""Google as a company has greatly benefited from academic research and this is one of the ways we can give back to the community,"" he said.

The project was also an effort, said Mr. Acharya, 39, to address a problem he confronted as an undergraduate in India. As a student he found materials in his college library, at times, to be significantly out of date.

Google Scholar will make the world's scientific literature universally accessible, he said.

""We don't know where the next breakthrough will come from,"" he said. ""We want everyone to be able to stand on the shoulders of giants.""

""Google's scientific search service is a significant step forward,"" said Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch, an online newsletter. He was quick to add, however, that Google was certain to have competition soon from Yahoo and others.

""We will continue to see an explosion of vertical search engines like this,"" he said of search services that focus on special collections.

Google Scholar is another reflection of changing habits in the academic world, said Mr. Sack of HighWire Press. In the past decade, students and researchers have begun to go to online search engines first.","Google Scholar is intended as a first stop for researchers looking for scholarly literature like peer-reviewed papers, books, abstracts and technical reports.","Generated Summary: AN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 - Google Inc. plans to announce on Thursday that it is adding a new search service aimed at scientists and academic researchers."
54,"The White House made an offer to House Republicans today to avert the fiscal cliff that Republican aides familiar with the talks panned as ""a joke"", ""an insult"" and ""a complete break from reality.""

A Republican aide familiar with the offer that was presented to House Speaker John Boehner by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House congressional liason Rob Nabors confirmed that the $4 trillion package would raise $1.6 trillion in tax revenue up front. Republicans call that number too high and extreme to be offering two weeks into negotiations with a just a month left before the deadline.

In exchange for the added tax revenue, Democrats would give in on $400 billion in spending cuts from entitlement programs like Medicare and an aide said those cuts would not be immediate. Boehner slammed that number right after the meeting at a press conference though he would not say what the number should be.

Play Video Boehner: ""No substantive progress"" on ""fiscal cliff"" talks

""Unfortunately many Democrats continue to rule out spending cuts that must be part of any significant agreement that will reduce our deficit"" Boehner said.

The package would be structured in such a way that some tax increases would happen now and tax reform would happen next year. Tax rates for the wealthiest two percent would go up immediately.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at the U.S. Capitol for meetings with congressional leaders November 29, 2012.

The offer, according to Republicans, would also include $50 billion in stimulus spending in the form of infrastructure projects, an extension of unemployment benefits and a extension of the two percent payroll tax break.

The White House would also like to avoid future fights over raising the debt ceiling by taking it out of Congress altogether. While Congress could act to block a debt limit increase, it would not be necessary for Congress to approve one.

One Republican aide expressed outrage that the White House would ask for that with no reforms attached at all. Earlier today, Boehner said, that ""there is a lot of things that I have wanted in my life but almost all of them had a price tag attached to them.

""If we're going to talk about the debt limit in this, then there is going to be some price tag associated with it.""

Democrats have been equally critical of Republicans in negotiations so far saying that Republicans have not put a real revenue offer on the table since they have not said how much money they'd be willing to put to the deficit through tax revenue.

""Right now, the only thing preventing us from reaching a deal that averts the fiscal cliff and avoids a tax hike on 98 percent of Americans is the refusal of Congressional Republicans to ask the very wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates,"" Deputy White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a written statement.

""The President has already signed into law over $1 trillion in spending cuts and we remain willing to do tough things to compromise, and it's time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices - from the business community to middle class Americans across the country - who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.""

Despite the appearance of talks breaking down today, Boehner said he's still optimistic a deal can be reached.

The White House's Nabors also seemed determined to keep talking.

55,"Kurds battling jihadists for the Syrian border town of Kobane have welcomed a first US airdrop of weapons as neighbouring Turkey said it would help Iraqi Kurds to join the fight.

Ankara has refused land deliveries of arms to the Syrian Kurds, who are linked with Turkey's outlawed rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), but said it was helping Iraqi Kurds to reinforce the strategic town.

The main Syrian Kurdish fighting force in Kobane hailed the airdrop, saying it would ""help greatly"" in the town's defence against a nearly five-week offensive by the Islamic State group (IS).

US Secretary of State John Kerry said it would have been ""irresponsible of us, as well as morally very difficult, to turn your back on a community fighting ISIL,"" using another acronym for IS.

The top US diplomat said the situation amounted to a ""crisis moment"" and insisted the move was not a shift in policy.

He echoed remarks by a senior administration official that the airdrop was in recognition of the ""impressive"" resistance put up by the Kurds and the losses they were inflicting on IS.

Washington's hope was that ""Kurds who have proven themselves to be very strong and valiant fighters will take this fight on,"" Kerry said.

Three C-130 cargo aircraft carried out what the US military called ""multiple"" successful drops of supplies, including small arms, provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq.

The supplies were ""intended to enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobane,"" said Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East.

The US-led coalition has carried out more than 135 air strikes against IS targets around Kobane, and an AFP correspondent just across the border in Turkey reported a fresh raid on Monday afternoon.

The main Syrian Kurdish fighting force in Kobane, the People's Protection Units (YPG), swiftly welcomed the US arms drop.

""The military assistance dropped by American planes at dawn on Kobane was good and we thank America for this support,"" said YPG spokesman Redur Xelil.

""It will have a positive impact on military operations against Daesh and we hope for more,"" he added.

IS militants launched their offensive on Kurdish fighters around Kobane on September 16, swiftly pushing them back to the town itself and sparking an exodus of 200,000 refugees over the border into Turkey.

But the Kurds have kept up a dogged resistance on the streets of the town, of which they currently control around half.

One senior administration official said Kurdish fighters had put up an ""impressive"" effort in the face of the IS but cautioned that the security situation was ""fluid"".

56,"FORTUNE — Be thankful he doesn’t take it all, George Harrison advised us about the Taxman nearly 50 years ago.

Those words are cold comfort to bitcoin boosters, who learned Thursday that the IRS expects users of the virtual currency to report their bitcoin transactions and pay capital gains taxes on their holdings, just as they would on a stock or a bond. The problem for enthusiasts of the virtual currency is that not only will they have to give the Feds a chunk of whatever capital gains they realize on their bitcoin holdings, the taxation of bitcoin as a currency will also constitute a serious hurdle for its widespread use.

Bitcoin, by design, is deflationary. After the 21 millionth bitcoin is mined, no more will ever be created. This distinguishes it from both fiat currencies, like the dollar, and even gold, the supplies of which grow over time. The problem is that as the economy and productivity grow, bitcoin will naturally become more valuable, creating a psychological incentive for people to hold onto rather than spend their bitcoin. This doesn’t disqualify bitcoin from being a widely used currency, but it is an impediment.

MORE: Gold vs. bitcoin: An apocalyptic showdown

And now that the IRS has officially said that it will tax it as property, there’s just one more speed bump in the road to bitcoin’s world domination. After all, taxpayers only have to cut the government in on their gains after they sell their assets, a stricture which happens to promote broadly beneficial behavior like long-term investing. It’s not such a great tax treatment, however, for a young currency that many expect to steadily increase in value but is also trying to achieve widespread use as a currency. In other words, the capital gains tax is an incentive for bitcoin users to hold onto, rather then spend, their bitcoins.

And as I’ve written earlier, the IRS’s tax treatment of bitcoin has embedded in it the irony that your bitcoin tax bill will be directly proportional to the dollar’s inflation. And since fear of dollar inflation is one argument in support of the use of bitcoin, the taxman stands to benefit even if bitcoin enthusiasts turn out to be right.","The IRS on Tuesday said that bitcoin will be taxed like property, creating another hurdle for its widespread use as a currency.",Generated Summary: finance.

The five-year research alliance involves Sanofi paying an initial $50 million to access DiCE’s technology and taking an equity stake in the U.S. firm.

The companies will then work on as many as 12 drug targets, with Sanofi contributing up to $184 million per target in research, clinical and regulatory milestone payments.

California-based DiCE specializes in producing novel medicines that can be given as pills but which tackle complex diseases that normally require treatment with injectable protein-based drugs.

In particular, DiCE believes its technology should enable monoclonal antibodies, which are given by injection or infusion, to be replaced by orally-administered medicines. Antibody drugs are used to treat various types of cancer, as well as serious immune system disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.

The approach may also open up ways to tackle conditions for which there are currently no good treatment options.

At least 49 people died and 53 were wounded in Sunday's shooting in Orlando with the rampage only coming to an end after perpetrator Omar Mateen was shot dead in a gun battle with police officers.

""Forty-eight of the 49 victims have been identified. Twenty-four of the next of kin have been notified with more to come,"" Buddy Dyer, the mayor of Orlando, said on Monday morning.Â

""We will not be defined by the act of a cowardly hater. We will be defined by how we respond, how we treat each other and this community has stepped up to do that,""Â Dyer added.

Orlando Police chief John Mina described the shooting as ""one of the worst tragedies we have seen"",Â adding that police officers ""were shaken by what they have seen inside the club"".

""It's a tragedy not only for the city but the entire nation,"" he said. ""Just a look into the eyes of our officers told the whole story.""

The injured, many in critical condition, were transferred to nearby hospitals. Among those injured was one police officer, whose kevlar helmet was hit by a round from the suspect. Â

The suspect exchanged gunfire with a police officer working at the club, which had more than 300 people inside. The gunman then went back inside and took hostages, Mina said.

Who was Orlando shooter Omar Mateen?

At around 5am, authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the hostages.

Ron Hopper, special FBI agent in charge of the Orlando office, confirmed that Mateen was interviewed twice by the agency in 2013, after he made ""inflammatory comments"" to co-workers alleging possible ""terrorist ties"".

In 2014, authorities interrogated Mateen anew for possible ties to an American suicide bomber.

In both cases, the FBI closed the investigations as they turned out to be ""inconclusive"" at that time, Hopper said. Â Â

Hopper also confirmed media reports that Mateen made 911 calls to police early on Sunday, and referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL also known as ISIS) group.

Late on Sunday, mourners gathered near the target of the attack, the Pulse nightclub, as well as landmarks in other cities.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast in the city and that security measures have been strengthened, in particular around places associated with the LGBT community.

De Blasio told reporters that the shooting, which also left dozens injured, was ""against our values"".

But ""you'll see a lot of additional police presence on the streets of the city,"" he added.

""No city in the world is better prepared to stop terror, to stop hate.""

Hundreds of people gathered on Sunday evening in Greenwich Village to reflect on the violence and leave flowers, candles and letters beside a sign reading ""Stop Hate"".Â

Earlier, US President Barack Obama condemned the shooting as ""an act of terror and an act of hate"", calling the shooter ""a person filled with hatred"".

""As Americans, we are united in grief and outrage,"" he said, adding that the attack was ""a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon"" and commit violence in the US.

Florida Governor Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency in Orlando.

Al Jazeera's Patty Culhane, reporting from Orlando, said politicians from opposite sides of the spectrum would be reacting in very different ways.

""It's been less than 24 hours but this is going to become a political issue ... what we're going to see is Democrats wanting to put the emphasis on [banning] semi-automatic weapons,"" Culhane said.

""The Republicans are going to try taking advantage of the fact that people are scared of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ... so we're going to see [Democrats and Republicans] put the emphasis on two very different things.""

The nightclub shooting came just a day after a man thought to be a deranged fan fatally shot Christina Grimmie, a rising singing star who gained fame on YouTube and as a contestant on The Voice, while she was signing autographs after a concert in Orlando.

The attacks were the worst in the US since the September 11 attacks carried out by al-Qaeda in 2001.

61,"Oil spilled from a well blowout in the Great Australian Bight could reach a wide stretch of the southern Australian coastline, new modelling has revealed.

BP has proposed drilling two exploration wells in the Bight and has released modelling on a worst case discharge from its Stromlo-1 well with no clean-up response.

It shows oil on the sea surface could travel up to 2650 kilometres from the well site and would almost certainly reach large sections of the South Australian coastline.

It also reveals up to a 64 per cent chance of it reaching Esperance in Western Australia and a 41 per cent chance of it stretching as far as the NSW south coast, depending on the time of year.

The company says it's confident a loss of control would be contained within 35 days, but says drilling a relief well to completely kill the blowout would take 149 days.

The modelling has angered environmental groups, which have called on the regulator to immediately reject BP's application to drill in the Bight.

""The risks posed by this project to the environment and to the coastal communities of southern Australia are simply too great,"" Wilderness Society national director Lyndon Schneiders said.

""The time has come for the regulator to terminate this project once and for all.""

The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) is expected to rule on BP's plans on September 29.

It has twice previously asked the company to rework its proposals because of environmental concerns.

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said NOPSEMA could not, in good conscience, allow the project to go ahead.

62,"The head of Canada's statistics agency has resigned in a surprising move over concerns that the agency's independence is being compromised, making him the second top statistician to quit in recent years.

In an email sent to the members of an independent advisory board, Wayne Smith said he was stepping down as head of Statistics Canada because of concerns around changes to the agency's data infrastructure.

Statistics Canada is responsible for producing major economic reports on everything from jobs to international trade.

In an arrangement under the previous Conservative government, responsibility for StatCan's informatics infrastructure was transferred to a department that oversees information technology services across the government.

Smith said in his email that Shared Services Canada now holds an effective veto over many of the agency's decisions, including the collection, analysis and dissemination of data.

""This loss of independence and control is not only an apprehension, but an effective reality today,"" Smith wrote in the email, adding that StatCan is increasingly hobbled by the ineffective and slow services being provided.

""I do not wish to preside over the decline of what is still, but cannot remain in these circumstances, a world leading statistical office.""

Concerns about confidentiality and efficiency had troubled Smith for some time, said Ian McKinnon, chair of the National Statistics Council advisory board.

""He felt that losing control of the data infrastructure was incompatible with the continued independence of the agency.""

The agency was criticised earlier this year for technological issues that delayed the release of some economic reports on its website.

Smith came to the job after Munir Sheikh resigned in protest in 2010 after the Conservatives scrapped the long-form census.

Anil Arora, who previously helped run Canada's census, will become chief statistician as of Monday, the government said.

In a nod to the concerns, Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said the government was working closely with the agency toward the reinforcement of its independence.

The concerns voiced by Smith come on top of some hiccups with releases in the past, said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

""It's going to raise a lot more questions than would have been in place before,"" said Porter.

The Houston-based company, which was the cement contractor for the BP well, was accused by both BP BP and victims of the oil spill for faulty cement work on the Macondo well. Halliburton stated in a release that an agreement still need to be cleared by a Louisiana court.

According to the release, the amount will “be paid into a trust until all appeals have been resolved in three installments over the next two years,” and also includes legal fees.

The settlement is the largest for Halliburton so far, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the other companies involved in settling claims have spent more to settle claims related to the spill. Transocean RIG paid $1.4 billion last year, according to Bloomberg, while BP has paid over $28 billion and could potentially face billions more.

BP started paying out claims back in July, according to Fortune.

So maybe those popular YouTube videos wouldn’t be enough?

Regardless of Boston Dynamics’s future, their legacy shows the power of what robots can do. Here are some of their widely-circulated videos:

This video, published on Feb. 23 shows a newer version of the two-legged humanoid robot trudging through snow, crouching and picking up boxes, and maintaining balance when an engineer hit it with a wooden stick. According to the video, the unit is designed to operate both outdoors and inside buildings, and is equipped with sensors that help it to avoid obstacles and gauge terrain.

Spot is leggy with an incredible sense of balance. Despite repeated kicks, it manages to remain standing. The 160-pound quadruped was designed to tackle rough terrain.

You don’t want to get in the way of a robot named “WildCat.” It’s the next generation of the Boston Dynamics’ “Cheetah” robot, which reached speeds up to 29 miles per hour, according to the company’s website. WildCat was designed to run fast on all types of terrain.

BigDog was one of the robots that started it all. It has evolved over the years, culminating into Spot, Boston Dynamics’s latest and stealthier model.

67,"A SIMPLE blood test commonly used to measure kidney function is a highly accurate predictor of heart attack and stroke in patients with high blood pressure, a new study indicates.

People with high levels of the substance creatinine in their blood were five times more likely to die of heart attack or stroke than those with low levels, researchers said.

Creatinine is a natural byproduct of the breakdown of muscle tissue. It is found in the blood and excreted in the urine. High levels of it in the blood indicate that the kidney is unable to cleanse it from the body.

In light of the new findings, patients with high blood pressure should have their creatinine levels tested at least once annually, the scientists said. If the levels are high, patients should probably seek more intensive treatment or take further precautions against heart disease, like losing weight, lowering cholesterol or cutting down on smoking.

''A high creatinine level is a warning light that the patient is at a very high risk,'' said Dr. Neil Schulman, who directed the study for the National Institutes of Health. He is an associate professor at the Emory University medical school in Atlanta.

Dr. Schulman noted that there has been no blood test to reliably predict the likelihood of heart attack or stroke in patients with high blood pressure.

He said the study showed that creatinine levels were more reliable in predicting death among hypertension patients than such factors as an elevated cholesterol level, diabetes, smoking or a history of heart trouble.

In addition, the study provides new evidence that therapy to control hypertension may also protect against kidney damage.

The study was reported this month in Hypertension, a journal published by the American Heart Association. It was based on data compiled during an eight-year project started in 1971. The project, which cost about $100 million, followed 10,500 patients with high blood pressure. High Levels of Creatinine

About 1,400 patients in the study had both hypertension and a creatinine level of at least 2 milligrams per deciliter of blood serum. Nearly 40 percent of these patients died in the eight years.

In contrast, about 9,000 patients had creatinine levels considered normal or below, and just 10 percent of them died in eight years. A normal creatinine level is 1.2 to 1.5 milligrams per deciliter.

Roughly 60 million Americans suffer from high blood pressure. Of the 500,000 fatal heart attacks annually, about 30 percent are attributed to hypertension. About half of the 150,000 fatal strokes each year are attributed to hypertension.

Researchers said that it is unclear whether people with high creatinine levels but no history of high blood pressure are at a greater risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke.

In addition, they said it was unclear why elevated creatinine levels indicate a greater risk. But a number of theories are being studied, said Dr. Jeffrey Cutler, chief of prevention and demonstration research at the National Institutes of Health.

One possibility involves hormones produced in the kidney. A malfunctioning kidney may produce altered or reduced levels of hormones, and these may damage the blood vessels of the heart and brain, the scientists said. Another possibility is that the kidney, and not the heart, may cause high blood pressure in some patients.","LEAD: A SIMPLE blood test commonly used to measure kidney function is a highly accurate predictor of heart attack and stroke in patients with high blood pressure, a new study indicates.","Generated Summary: A SIMPLE blood test commonly used to measure kidney function is a highly accurate predictor of heart attack and stroke in patients with high blood pressure, a new study indicates."
68,"Hershey has named 11-year veteran Michele Buck to serve as the chocolate maker's next president and CEO, an appointment that comes at a time when Big Food manufacturers find themselves challenged by smaller startup rivals.

Buck, who currently serves as COO at Hershey, will officially begin to steer the company on March 1. She succeeds John P. Bilbrey, who in October had announced his intention to retire from the candy maker in 2017. The maker of the namesake chocolate, Reese's, and Twizzlers said that compensation arrangements for both Buck and Bilbrey—who will continue as non-executive chairman of the board—hasn't yet been determined.

Since joining Hershey in 2005, Buck has steered a few notable strategies including the acquisitions of Krave beef jerky and healthy chocolate brand barkThins. She also spearheaded the company's growing core confection portfolio. Buck, who is 55, was picked to serve as CEO after Hershey said it reviewed both internal and external candidates as it mulled the succession.

Like many of the nation's largest food and beverage manufacturers, Hershey has faced some sales challenges as it confronts changing consumer preferences that include a move away from big established brands in favor of upstart rivals—a trend that has led to some deal-making like the acquisitions Hershey has been involved in. Still, sales growth remains a challenge for most. Hershey's sales slipped in 2015 to $7.39 billion from $7.42 billion the prior year. Hershey is predicting a slim increase of just around 1% for 2016.

Hershey even found itself the takeover target of snacking giant Mondelez (mdlz), a deal that died earlier this year after Mondelez said it realized that there was no path forward toward an agreement. The potential $23 billion hostile takeover effort was stonewalled by the Milton Hershey Trust, which controls 80% of shareholder votes at Hershey. Buck will now be responsible for leading Hershey into the future as a stand-alone company.

The appointment of Buck is notable for a few reasons. With Hershey's $7.4 billion in annual revenue, she will become one of just 25 women to run a Fortune 500 company. Hershey ranked #362 on the most recent list. Her appointment also adds another women to the growing list of female executives that steer Big Food companies. Other notable executives on that list include PepsiCo's (pep) Indra Nooyi, Campbell Soup's (cpb) Denise Morrison, and Mondelez's Irene Rosenfeld—all who rank on Fortune's Most Powerful Women list.

The changing of the guard at Hershey is also the third notable change at the top of a major food and beverage brand this month.

69,"US security firm says 1.2 billion internet credentials have been stolen. (AAP)

Russian hackers stole 1.2 billion internet credentials from major US companies and others around the world in what is likely the biggest data breach ever, security researchers say.

The US firm Hold Security said the gang which it dubbed ""CyberVor"" collected confidential user names and passwords were stolen from some 420,000 websites, ranging from household names to small internet sites.

""As long as your data is somewhere on the World Wide Web, you may be affected by this breach,"" Hold said in a statement on its website.

""Your data has not necessarily been stolen from you directly. It could have been stolen from the service or goods providers to whom you entrust your personal information, from your employers, even from your friends and family.""

The security firm, which specialises in research on large data breaches, said the cybergang acquired databases of stolen credentials from fellow hackers on the black market, and then installed malware that allowed them to gain access to many websites and social media accounts.

""To the best of our knowledge, they mostly focused on stealing credentials, eventually ending up with the largest cache of stolen personal information, totalling over 1.2 billion unique sets of emails and passwords,"" the researchers said.

""The CyberVors did not differentiate between small or large sites. They didn't just target large companies; instead, they targeted every site that their victims visited. With hundreds of thousands sites affected, the list includes many leaders in virtually all industries across the world, as well as a multitude of small or even personal websites.""

The researchers dubbed the hacker group CyberVor, using the Russian word ""vor,"" for thief.

The New York Times first reported the breach, and said the group of hackers based their operation in south central Russia, flanked by Kazakhstan and Mongolia, the report said.

The Times said the group includes fewer than a dozen men in their 20s and that their computer servers are believed to be in Russia.

71,"Walt Disney’s dis Hong Kong theme park posted its first net loss in four years in 2015 as Chinese visitor numbers slumped, a potential headache for the U.S. firm as it prepares to open its first mainland Chinese park in June.

The park posted a net loss of HK$148 million ($19 million) for the year, dropping into the red after three straight years of profits, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council Panel on Economic Development said in a report released on Monday.

Hong Kong has been hit hard by slowing economic growth in China, which has battered the number of big-spending Chinese tourists traveling to the city. Its retail sales saw their worst annual decline last year since 2002.

Hong Kong tourist arrivals fell 2.5% in 2015 to 59.32 million, the first decline since 2003 when the city lifted travel restrictions for some mainland Chinese. Mainland visitors account for about three quarters of visitors.

“The tourism industry of Hong Kong was greeted with great challenges due to external factors as well as overall market condition and sentiment,” the report, posted on China’s Tourism Commission website, said.

The Hong Kong Disney park saw revenues of HK$5.1 billion in 2015, a decrease of 6% against a year earlier, the report said, the first revenue drop for the park since 2009. Visitor numbers also fell nearly 10%, the first decline since at least 2008, driven by a steep drop in mainland guests.

“Lower visitation from mainland China and the region largely contributed to softer overall theme park attendance,” Disney said in a statement emailed to Reuters.

The opening of the larger Shanghai resort could dent the fortunes of the Hong Kong park further, the panel said in the report, adding the park was looking at how to stay competitive in light of “intensifying competition” and “the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort in June this year.”

Disney’s $5.5 billion Shanghai resort, a joint venture between the U.S. entertainment giant and Chinese state-backed consortium Shanghai Shendi Group, is slated to open on June 16.

He says the idea came to him over two years ago. Since then he's been recruiting a world-class team of professors, scientists and environmentalists to make his idea a reality.

""My hypothesis is that my life will be better,"" Wilson says. ""I'll be fulfilling a richer life by living a smaller life.""

Last night was the first night in his new home. Wilson says that in this phase of the project, the only thing he has to keep him warm during the cold Texas nights is his sleeping bag.

He's embracing the simplicity, and welcoming the changes that will come in the next year of the project. Instead of being strapped down to expensive monthly rent, he'll be a homeowner with his mortgage paid off.

But dumpster living comes with challenges, like walking a mile down the hill to the town lake for water.

The outlook is positive, though. Wilson says in six months he hopes to have things like an air conditioner and an X-box. A shower, a toilet and even WiFi is in the works, too.

Dr. Wilson has a whole team behind him, including a student organization called Green is the New Black. He says team members can even volunteer to spend the night in the dumpster and give him the night off. As the project progresses, the team will be fundraising for low-energy appliances and electronics, and will monitor the energy used on the team's blog.

He'll be taking his dumpster home to local elementary schools and sharing his project with the students. It gives the students the opportunity to give him design ideas and ask questions. One of the most pressing so far: ""How is Santa going to get in?""

73,"AOL has laid off about 100 employees as it integrates with its new corporate parent, Verizon, TechCrunch reported on Tuesday.

The latest round of layoffs was not completely unexpected. Verizon purchased AOL for $4.4 billion earlier this year, and many AOL units also overlap with existing Verizon divisions. Reuters confirmed the cuts with an AOL spokesperson, who said “we are aligning the organization for the same level of growth in 2016.”

As many as two-thirds of the cuts are in AOL’s membership division, which handles legacy business: Mainly its famous dial-up service, but also AOL Mail and AIM. According to the report, some staffers in marketing and social media roles have also been affected, but the majority of the layoffs focus on the “operations layer,” according to the report. The layoffs are just under 2% of AOL’s 6,000 workers.

Verizon bought AOL for its advertising technology and video operations, not its dial-up business. Still, it generates a substantial amount of revenue, mostly due to the fact that 2.1 million people still use AOL dial-up, paying an average of $20 per month. The last time that AOL reported earnings as an independent company, the membership division generated $186 million in revenue in a single quarter.

However, Verizon vz has its own Internet subscription products and consumer service departments, so it makes sense to reduce overlap where possible.

“The market changes and we at AOL change ahead of the market. As we have continued to do over the last six years, we have re-aligned a handful of key customer functions to put our consumers and customers more squarely at the center. We have done 3 years of deals in the last 6 months,” an AOL spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.

Bertarelli and his family sold the company to Merck KGaA of Germany in a 2007 deal valued at $13.3 billion in US dollars.

Babson President Kerry Healey commented on the gift in a statement.

“Families are the dominant form of business organization worldwide and they play a leading role in the social and economic wealth creation of communities and countries,” Healey said. “For almost a century, Babson has been at the forefront educating entrepreneurial families and conducting research and programming to help family enterprises achieve continued growth. Thanks to the generosity of the Bertarelli Foundation, we will make even greater strides developing the entrepreneurial mindsets and capabilities that enable business families to think and act more entrepreneurially in all contexts.”

In a separate statement, co-chair Dona Bertarelli of the Bertarelli Foundation added: “Family entrepreneurs face a unique challenge. As their businesses grow or change, they, too, need to adapt and evolve. At the same time, they need to preserve the original and special strengths, passions, and entrepreneurial characteristics of the family as they move in new directions. Through this faculty chair and our partnership with Babson College, we will have the opportunity to study this dynamic and help a new generation of individuals become tomorrow’s family entrepreneurs.”","Babson College has announced that the Bertarelli Foundation is funding a new faculty chair, the Bertarelli Foundation Distinguished Professor of Family Entrepreneurship, with a $3 million gift.","Generated Summary: Babson College has announcedBabson College has announced that the Bertarelli Foundation is funding a new faculty chair, the Bertarelli Foundation is funding a new faculty chair, the Bertarelli Foundation Distinguished Professor of Family Entrepreneurship, with a $3 million gift."
77,"Women need to begin thinking about their reproductive options early – in their 20s and 30s – rather than the 40s when it may be too late, said Alison Zimon, a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF, an infertility treatment center with locations in Boston and surrounding suburbs.

As women delay childbearing, there can be unrealistic expectations that medical science can undo the effects of aging.

“I do believe that most women understand age is important,” said Zimon, “but perhaps are unaware that age is the simple most predictive factor for reproductive success.”

Who is your typical patient?

We see all types of people, from women with longtime partners to those who have just broken off relationships. There are single women debating whether they should consider donor sperm, same sex couples hoping to build a family, those considering a surrogate mother, and more.

How often does treatment result in pregnancy?

For in-vitro fertilization, the success rate is good — 50 to 60 percent pregnancy rate in one attempt. Of course, younger women have a much higher chance of pregnancy. With a donor egg – using someone else’s egg — it’s 65 percent.

What’s the approximate cost of fertility treatment?

Typically an IVF cycle is a little more than $8,000 dollars; genetic testing of an embryo, $2,000 to $5,000.

Do you feel psychological health affects patients’ ability to get pregnant?

Infertility is incredibly stressful. A lot of data indicates that perhaps reducing stress may lead to better outcomes, but it’s not definite.

Isn’t infertility medicine amazing because it evolves so rapidly?

We’ve made tremendous strides especially when realizing that the first IVF baby was only 36 years ago.

Technological advances have improved the egg-freezing process, making it possible for women to delay motherhood, store their eggs, and use them later.

Why did you choose to become a fertility specialist?

You can really help people. It’s heartbreaking to see women struggle with infertility and very satisfying to offer treatment with such good outcomes.

What’s a success story that was meaningful to you?

Among the most meaningful is the story of a nurse with Hodgkins lymphoma. After a three-year course of chemotherapy and radiation, she overcame her cancer, but developed ovarian failure. Then, after a single-treatment cycle using donated eggs, she became pregnant. She gave birth to her daughter, now 2 years old, who is the joy of her and her husband’s life.

You were trained in obstetrics, but don’t deliver babies. What is it like saying goodbye to patients once they are pregnant?

These are happy goodbyes, and fortunately life often finds ways for me to reconnect.","Women need to begin thinking about their reproductive options early – in their 20s and 30s –  said Alison Zimon, a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF","Generated Summary: Women need to begin thinking about their reproductive options early – in their 20s and 30s – rather than the 40s when it may be too late, said Alison Zimon, a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF, an infertility treatment center with locations in Boston and surrounding suburbs."

The Commerce Department reported retail and food services sales for September, adjusted for seasonal variations and holidays but not price changes, were $442.7 billion, a decline of 0.3% from the prior month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had projected a 0.1% drop.

The September decline suggests Americans are still reluctant to splurge on consumer goods.

Gasoline stations posted a 0.8% drop on a sequential basis, hurt by weaker prices at the pump. The retail price of gasoline for the average American has dropped nearly 15% since late June to an average of $3.17 a gallon, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited data from Gasbuddy.com.

Meanwhile, motor vehicle and parts dealers’ sales also dropped 0.8%, while clothing and clothing accessories stores sales were down 1.2%. Both of those sequential declines aren’t exactly a surprise, as the auto industry historically sells more vehicles in August and apparel makers also do better then, when the key Back-to-School season has kicked into high gear.

There were a few pockets of notable growth.

•originally published 01/29/2015 AT 02:15 PM EST

Since first opening Mott Hall Bridges Academy in Brownsville, Brooklyn, five years ago, nothing has brought Principal Nadia L. Lopez's students as much joy as Brandon Stanton did on Monday.

After running into a young boy on the street, who attends Lopez's middle school in Brownsville – a high-crime area – Stanton captured a photo of him sharing his story on Jan. 19 for his popular Facebook page

When asked who has influenced his life the most, he responded, ""My principal, Ms. Lopez.""

Moved by the boy's story, Stanton found Lopez and

. Amazed by the staff and the school, he asked her what she would like to come out of this. She said she wanted her students to have the same experience she did when she went to Harvard.

Lopez always associated Harvard with wealth and high socioeconomic status. She didnât feel like she'd ever belong. But when she went to visit when she was studying at Boston College during a summer program, she realized that she was wrong and the school ended up really resonating with her. She wanted her students to know they can aim high.

for her students to take a trip to Harvard. They reached their goal of $100,000 in 45 minutes and even surpassed it, raising over $1 million.

Now, they've raised enough money to take the entire school – which covers sixth through eighth grade – this spring and every incoming sixth grade class to come. With the leftover money, they plan on organizing a summer program that will help close some achievement gaps.

Lopez told the students in an assembly on Monday, where they ""clapped and screamed so loud.""

""So many students were coming up to me and hugging me,"" Lopez tells PEOPLE. ""They asked, 'Wait that's the really smart school, right? So we're smart?' and I replied that they are very smart!""

Rhonda Arnold, an eighth grader and the vice president of the student council at the school, couldnât wait to brag to her parents.

""When I first found out, I was out of words,"" Rhonda tells PEOPLE. ""I was so surprised. I never thought we'd be able to take a trip like that.""

Rhonda feels grateful to have Lopez as her principal.

""She encourages us and always tells us that we matter and can become something even with what society may say,"" Rhonda says.

Lopez has a special approach when teaching her students' lessons. She doesnât outright suspend them unless they've done things numerous times. Instead, she tries to be proactive when dealing with them.

""Children want to be heard and some students are angry with their life circumstances,"" Lopez says. ""My goal is to remind them that with every choice they make comes a consequence and a benefit. Based off the choice, it directly impacts what the next step will be.""

Lopez feels humbled to be one of her student's ""most influential person"" and finds it symbolic that he said it on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

""It came at a time when I thought my work wasn't making a difference and there was a lot of violence going on in the world. I could see the defeat in my staff's eyes,"" Lopez says.

The school's color is purple, representing royalty. The students arenât the only ones who have to wear uniforms – the entire staff wears purple and black every day, including Lopez.

""Our school color makes me feel royal,"" Rhonda says. ""I feel like I have to work hard in this school because royal people don't just sit down and do nothing, they work.""",Photographer Brandon Stanton raised money to take the students on trips Harvard,Generated Summary: Nadia...

United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing that builds and flies the Delta 4 rocket, plans to try again at 7:05 a.m. EST (1205 GMT) on Friday.

Gusty winds at the seaside spaceport initially postponed the launch for more than an hour Thursday morning.

The countdown was restarted after the weather cleared, but was halted again when two valves on the rocket apparently failed to close about three minutes before liftoff. With the glitch unresolved before the end of Thursday's two-and-a-half hour launch window, Orion's test flight was postponed.

""Despite the valiant attempts of the launch teams and mission managers  we basically ran out of time in trying to troubleshoot the last of the issues,'' said NASA launch commentator Michael Curie.

For its orbital debut Orion, which is flying without a crew, is expected to soar as far as 3,600 miles (5,800 km) from Earth so that it can slam back into the atmosphere at a speed of about 20,000 mph (32,000 km/h), giving its heat shield a workout of 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 degrees Celsius).

Splashdown in the Pacific Ocean is expected about four-and-a-half hours after launch. Eventually, NASA plans to use Orion capsules to fly astronauts to and from Mars.

NASA already has spent more than $9 billion developing Orion, which will make a second test flight without crew in about four years. A third mission, expected around 2021, will include two astronauts on a flight that will send the capsule into a high orbit around the moon.

Since the end of the Apollo moon program in 1972, the United States and the rest of the space-faring world have flown crews only into orbits that are a few hundred miles from Earth.

""This flight is a big step toward fulfilling a promise we made to the American people when we retired the space shuttle that we are going to take that money and build some incredible vehicles that can do amazing things,'' said astronaut Rex Walheim.

The maximum number of characters in a post could be raised to as much as 10,000, or it could be half that, depending on how users respond to trials, said the person, who asked not be identified as the changes haven’t been decided.

Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has been pushing the company to think of ways to make the product more engaging. Last month, Twitter began experimenting with a new order that shows users the most relevant content first, instead the usual format of displaying recent posts in reverse chronological order. In August, Twitter removed the 140-character message for direct private messages sent between users.

Re/code reported earlier on Tuesday that Twitter was considering the new limit. Aly Pavela, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Twitter, declined to comment.

A rapid reaction spread across Twitter in the wake of the report:

The U.S. Justice Department, which has pushed the rule change since 2013, has described it as a minor modification needed to modernize the criminal code for the digital age, and has said it would not permit searches or seizures that are not already legal.

85,"France’s Danone said on Thursday it would double the size of its U.S. business by buying organic food producer WhiteWave Foods in a deal that values the company at $12.5 billion including debt.

The purchase will help the French company to pursue affluent consumers by adding WhiteWave’s popular health food offerings such as Silk almond milk and Earthbound Farm Organic salad to its portfolio, as it struggles with setbacks in more challenging markets such as Brazil and Russia.

It is the first major transaction by Emmanuel Faber who took over as Danone’s chief executive in 2014 and has vowed to return the group to “strong profitable and sustainable growth” by 2020.

Danone danoy , best known for its yoghurts Activia and Actimel, is offering $56.25 per share in cash for its largest acquisition since the purchase of Dutch group Numico in 2007.

That represents a premium of 24 percent over WhiteWave’s 30-day average closing trading price, Danone said.

“We are creating a truly global leader in line with lasting consumer trends for more healthier options,” Faber told a call with analysts.

By 8:45 a.m. GMT, Danone shares were up 6% at 67.15 euros, leading gainers on the CAC-40 index of French blue chips as investors welcomed the deal despite the premium being paid.

WhiteWave’s products have outperformed mainstream packaged food businesses in recent years as they are in line with a consumer shift toward natural foods and healthier eating.

WhiteWave wwav has been seen as an attractive takeover target since its spin-off from Dean Foods, especially for companies like General Mills and Campbell Soup that have been buying healthier brands or reformulating their existing products.

“WhiteWave is the fastest growing U.S food company (10 percent Compounded Annual Growth Rate like for like sales over the last 3 years, 20 percent including acquisitions) and an excellent fit with Danone, focusing on organic, dairy foods,” said Canaccord Genuity Limited analysts.

WhiteWave generates $4 billion of sales and Danone said it will be able to achieve synergies of $300 million by 2020, representing 8% of WhiteWave’s 2015 sales and 80% of WhiteWave 2015 Earnings Before Interest and Taxes.

The deal, which will be 100% debt financed and will boost earnings per share from the first year after closing, was approved by the boards of both companies.

“This transaction will create a leading U.S. refrigerated dairy player, as well as one of the top 15 largest U.S. food and beverage manufacturers,” Danone said.

86,"WASHINGTON — Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.

The American Bankers Association complained on Thursday that bankers around the country were “extremely upset” about how the Treasury Department was trying to offer them billions of dollars in fresh capital.

“These bankers believe they are being asked — in some cases pressured — to participate in a program they did not want and do not need,” wrote Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, in a blistering letter to the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.

Saying he had “deep concerns with the lack of clarity about the program,” Mr. Yingling said the confusion had grown sharply this week over what the government’s purpose was.

The bank lobbying group said the main confusion was over whether the purpose of the program was to shore up healthy banks, as Mr. Paulson has insisted, or to rescue failing ones.

Mr. Yingling said he was alarmed that lawmakers in Congress were criticizing the Bush administration for its reluctance to impose tougher restrictions on banks that accept government money. Some Democratic lawmakers have complained that banks are taking taxpayer money with one hand while paying out dividends to shareholders with the other. Some policy makers have also complained that banks are not lending enough and might be paying their executives too much.

Since the Treasury Department introduced its plan, officials have stressed that their goal was to strengthen healthy banks and get them to revive their lending. Officials are also encouraging the takeovers of sick banks by healthy ones, as they did last week when the Treasury approved the bailout program’s purchase of $7.7 billion of preferred shares in PNC Financial Services and rejected an application from National City Bank, based in Cleveland. National City quickly agreed to a takeover by PNC.

But the focus on healthy banks has created baffling contradictions. Healthy banks have been reluctant to take the government money, in part because they feared being stigmatized as needy or vulnerable.

Mr. Paulson essentially strong-armed several of the country’s biggest banks into participating when he announced the program earlier this month.

To attract healthy banks into the program, Treasury officials also imposed as few restrictions as possible for those that received money. Banks could still keep paying dividends. They had only limited restrictions on executive bonuses and compensation. And the government would not force the banks to make loans they did not want to make.

But that only raised the question: why was the government trying to give those banks money in the first place?

Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, sent letters to the nine biggest financial institutions on Wednesday, demanding a “detailed accounting” of the next round of bonuses they planned to pay.

Mr. Yingling said many healthy banks might want to take advantage of the Treasury’s offer, but not if they had to suspend dividends or accept restrictions on executive pay.

“It would make no sense for a well-capitalized bank with solid earnings to agree to a program which would greatly lower the value of its stock,” Mr. Yingling wrote.

87,"Six years after the 2008 financial crisis, new business growth remains sluggish. A new study shows that not only did fewer new ventures launch, but those that did were concentrated in major cities, rather than in small towns and rural communities.

From 2010 to 2014 there was a net of 166,500 new businesses in the U.S., half of which were generated in metropolitan areas like Silicon Valley, Houston, Miami and New York City, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns program analyzed by the bipartisan Economic Innovation Group.

That’s only about a 2.3% uptick in net new business growth, much lower than the new businesses opened following the last two financial recessions. In fact, nearly three out of five counties analyzed actually reported more businesses open than closed between 2010 and 2014.

Compare that with the 1990s recovery, which recorded a 6.7% net increase in new businesses, while the 2000s recovery following the dot-com bubble saw a similar increase of 5.6%.

But not only was the rise in new business generation during this recovery smaller, the concentration of growth in major cities is unusual. During the 1990s recovery, 125 counties were responsible for half of the net total new business establishments in the country. But in the most recent recovery, only 20 counties in dense metropolitan areas generated half of the net new business growth achieved.

The 1990s recovery also showed the smallest counties added new businesses at the fastest rate. That trend slowed during the 2000s recovery — and by the most recent recovery period in the 2010s, it reversed. From 2010 to 2014, all counties with fewer than 1 million people averaged far lower business growth rates than the national average, while those with over a million people did better.

Each arm is elegantly posed in mid-movement with the flattened palm in a different position, each of which has symbolic meaning — he is saying, ""Have no fear."" In one hand Shiva holds the flame of destruction, in another the drum of creation. Around him is a great nimbus of fire, symbolising the cosmos.

The cosmic arc also serves as a support for this exquisite Chola bronze from southern India, made in about 1100. But even with that cunning assistance, this is a masterpiece of bronze casting. The most instantly striking thing about Hindu religious art is its sensuality — but what makes it great is that this is tempered by balance and harmony. Hindu sculptors find deep beauty in the human form, and see this beauty as part of a larger cosmic order. To put this sculpture's achievement bluntly, to give this much grace to a figure that has four arms is a miracle.

Hindu art values curves; its sensuously observed bodies have narrow waists and wide hips. Even an elephant-headed god can be a graceful dancer in this superlative visual tradition: in an 11th century panel from Khajuraho in Madya Pradesh, Ganesha has a sinuous, curving trunk, opulent belly and fleshy limbs, and is nude except for jewellery. There's once again enormous skill deployed generously here — to make a hybrid like this look so alive, so beautiful and humane is an amazing achievement.

Hindu sculpture is not just about the body, however. It is crowded with narrative scenes of tumultuous energy. Buildings like the Hoysaleshvara temple in Halebid, Karnataka, dating from 1121, teem and flow with sculptural decoration. Shiva dances in the skin of an elephant demon, Krishna lifts a mountain, and smaller figures dance, process and lead elephants in this temple's soapstone reliefs. There's an abundance to it all, a full response of life's power, that makes Hindu sculpture one of religion's great gifts to art.

Hindu art made a powerful impact on the first modernists. You have only to look at Matisse's sculptures of the nude to realise that their bulbous, rollicking, curvaceous anatomies take more inspiration from India than from Greece.

90,"Syrian regime forces have edged forward in the northern province of Aleppo with air cover from Russian warplanes but face fierce resistance from rebel forces in the country's centre.

Since Moscow began its air campaign in support of its Damascus ally on September 30, the army and its allies have launched four ground offensives against rebel forces in northern and central Syria, the latest push forward in a years-long conflict that a monitor said has killed more than 250,000 people.

Syrian troops have gone on the attack in Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Latakia provinces, taking advantage of Russian air strikes against al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front and other rebel groups.

Control of Aleppo city - Syria's pre-war economic hub - has been divided since mid-2012, with government forces controlling the western part of the city while much of the surrounding province is held by rebel groups, ranging from Nusra and others in the west to the Islamic State group (IS) in the east.

The front lines there and in the surrounding countryside have long been stable.

On Saturday, three senior Nusra members, one of them a US-designated ""global terrorist"", were killed in an air strike in Aleppo province a monitoring group said on Thursday.

Regime troops seized at least five villages and several strategic hilltops on Saturday, bringing them to the edges of Al-Hader, just south of Aleppo city, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Taking the village would provide the government a key supply route between Aleppo and the central province of Hama, according to Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman.

He said that over the previous 24 hours, 17 rebels and eight pro-regime fighters had been killed, while around 2,000 families had fled the fighting. In all, he said, more than 250,000 people had been killed since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.

Coca-Cola ko is being forced to change its Vitaminwater labels.

The company has just settled a lawsuit about misleading claims that it has previously made about the drink. As part of the settlement, WTOP reports, the beverage company will no longer be allowed to use those claims and it must add the words “added sugars” in two places on the Vitaminwater label.

Jeff Cronin, the director of communications for the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a litigant in the case, tells WTOP that this settlement is good news for consumers. Vitaminwater labels previously had health claims like “vitamins + water = all you need” and “this combination of zinc and fortifying vitamins can…keep you healthy as a horse.” They also suggested that the drink could help prevent chronic disease and eye disease, and it could promote healthy joins and “optimal immune function.” Coca-Cola removed those claims from labels during the litigation process, which began in 2009.

“Sugary drinks are strongly linked with weight gain, diabetes, and even heart disease,” Cronin told WTOP. A 20-ounce serving of Vitaminwater contains between 29 and 31 grams of sugar. The recommended maximum daily intake is 37.5 grams for adult men and 25 grams for adult women.

“We are pleased to reach an amicable resolution of this case,” a Coca Cola spokesperson told Fortune. “Although we remain confident in our legal position, it simply made no sense to continue this costly legal battle.”",As part of a lawsuit settlement,Generated Summary: Coca-Cola is being forced to change its Vitaminwater labels.
92,"26-year-old Meredith Perry has big ambitions to roll out the first truly wireless charging device. And now she has two experienced new executives to help her do so.

uBeam, the company Perry started in 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania with fellow student Nora Dweck, has earned scores of buzz and attention—all before ever launching a product. Its aim is to sell a small panel that uses ultrasound waves to charge a device, like a smartphone, from across the room. (While wireless charging already exists—there are power mats galore—Perry argues these are not true wireless chargers because the device still needs to be placed on a base.)

As Perry has toiled away on her invention, she has attracted some of the biggest names around as investors, including Marc Andreessen (who compares uBeam to “the Harry Potter world”), Mark Cuban (he calls it a “zillion-dollar idea”) and Marissa Mayer (she invested 15 minutes after first meeting Perry.)

This week, uBeam announced it has hired two mobile veterans to give the company some senior gravitas. Jeff Devine, who has held senior roles at Nokia and Cisco, has joined as uBeam’s COO, and Monica Hushen, who has held finance roles at Apple and Palm, has joined as CFO. “Our focus is shifting from small-scale prototype development to large-scale production of product for the masses as we approach our launch,” said Perry in a statement. “Jeff and Monica bring extensive industry experience at large-scale, multinational organizations taking multiple hardware and consumer electronics devices from prototype through production.”

Along with the two new hires, uBeam has received another $10 million in funding—not a new round, but a convertible note, from investors including superagent Ari Emmanuel’s VC fund WME Ventures—bringing its total funding to $23 million.

That money will help Perry continue to staff up as she attempts to launch a product that she believes will convert uBeam’s many doubters: “There may be people on the Internet who don’t believe it’s true,” Perry told Fortune earlier this summer. But when people see the product with their own eyes, she insists, “they are are converted instantly.”",It has hired mobile industry veterans and raised a ton of cash.,Generated Summary: 26-year-old Meredith Perry has big ambitions to roll out the first truly wireless charging device.

93,"Members of the British parliament have strongly voted to renew the country's ageing nuclear weapons system, a multibillion-dollar project regarded as key to maintaining the country's status as a world power following its vote to leave the European Union.

Despite opposition from the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) and some in the opposition Labour Party, parliament approved the Scottish-based nuclear-armed Trident submarines by 472 to 117 votes.

In her first statement in parliament as prime minister on Monday, Theresa May said Britain needed to retain its nuclear deterrent, which had been an insurance policy for the country's security for nearly 50 years.

Whistleblower reignites UK's nuclear-deterrent debate

""What this country needs to do is to recognise that it faces a variety of threats and to ensure we have the capabilities that are necessary and appropriate to deal with each of those threats,"" May said before the vote to approve the manufacture of four new nuclear-armed submarines.

The Trident programmeÂ replaces the country's fleet ofÂ nuclear-armed submarinesÂ with four new vessels at an estimated cost of $54bn over the next 20 years.

May did not hesitate when a member of the opposition asked whether she would be willing to order a nuclear strike.

""The nuclear threat has not gone away; if anything, it has increased,"" May said, referencing a newly assertive Russia and a desire from countries including North Korea to acquire nuclear weapons in defiance of the international community.

May also said that while Britain has voted to leave the European Union, ""we will not leave our NATO and European allies behind.

""We cannot outsource the grave responsibility we shoulder for keeping our people safe,"" she said, adding that scrapping the Trident submarine-based weapons system would be ""a reckless gamble, a gamble that would enfeeble our allies and embolden our enemies.""

Hans Blix backs Corbyn's call to scrap UK's Trident

Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a life-long nuclear disarmament campaigner, questioned the need for Britain to possess ""weapons of mass destruction"" and said the country should, instead, press for a nuclear-free world.

""I would not take a decision that kills millions of people, I do not believe the threat of mass murder is a legitimate way to go about dealing with international relations,"" said Corbyn, though many of his own party members voted in favour of replacing the nuclear weapons system.

Al Jazeera's Europe Correspondent Barnaby Phillips said the vote to renew the weapons system was important for May following Britain's recent decision to leave the European Union.

""Theresa May hopes that this vote will send a message to Britain's allies, all of which were so disappointed by the Brexit vote. She argues that Britain is still an outward-looking country; a major military power prepared to take on international responsibilities in a dangerous and unpredictable world,"" he said.

But, it also means that ""the chilling logic of mutually assured destruction is still with us, more than a quarter of a century after the end of the Cold War,"" Phillips said.

About 1,000 fans bought tickets for one-hour pleasure flights run by the company to mark the aircraft's passing.

On Thursday, a group flew on the plane's final international journey from Dhaka to Birmingham and Radio 2 DJ Janice Long, who worked on a Laker Airways DC-10 in the 1970s, gave the in-flight announcements to passengers.

""When I worked for Laker I never got to do the announcement, which is strange when you consider what I do now,"" she said.

Biman originally said the plane's final resting place would be Bruntingthorpe Aviation Museum in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, but the firm has since decided to return it to Bangladesh to be scrapped.

Museum boss David Walton said it had been ""looking forward"" to receiving the DC-10.

98,"A lone caretaker charged with guarding a ghost town far above the Arctic Circle has described his isolated life, giving tours and warding off polar bears.

Spying an advertisement for the position of Pyramiden's caretaker and guide in the Russian Geographical Society, Aleksandr Romanovsky wrote a detailed letter emphasising why he would be the ideal candidate for the position.

On reflection, he now believes he may have been the only person to apply.

Armed with a rifle, Romanovsky, who has become known as ""Sasha from Pyramiden"", has been looking after the frozen town since 2012.

Aleksandr Romanovsky guards the ghost town of Pyramiden.

Once a bustling mining settlement, Pyramiden, was home to more than a 1000 people before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In 1998 a decision was made to close down the coal mine and send everyone back to the mainland.

Today the lonely locale accommodates only six people who live semi-permanently on the island.

Pyramiden has become utopia of sorts for the tiny population that lives there, with residents ordered to forgo the political turmoil of the outside world.

Pyramiden has a population of only six

""We need to the friendly, peaceful and we need to treat each other with respect. That's why political talks are strictly forbidden here. If they were not forbidden I have no idea what would happen,"" Romanovsky said.

""Two of us are from western Ukraine, two of us are from Donetsk, two of us are Russians, so it's better to keep silence and live in peace.""

Every day the lone caretaker makes a call to his office located 100km to the south to find out if he will be expecting company from the mainland.

Due to the town's isolated position, Romanovsky said irregular postal services were the only way to remain in contact with friends and family.

""Sometimes a helicopter delivers us correspondence… it’s the most precious thing here.""

The caretaker said one of the problems with living so far from society was having to deal with the occasional polar bear.

""Last autumn in October we had an accident and a polar bear broke in. That night we were all pretty scared. I was supposed to be eaten first because I live on the second floor and the others live on the fourth floor,"" he said.

After devouring the town supply of beer, nuts and mayonnaise, the bear climbed back out the window and disappeared into the snow.

Scientists at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre have

to more effectively deliver chemotherapy to brain tumors by non-invasively permeating the blood-brain barrier.

That barrier has been likened to a 'Saran Wrap'—it coats the brain's blood vessels and protects one of our most vital organs from toxic substances.

But its protective ability has proven a challenge for cancer treatments.

Dr. Todd Mainprize, principal investigator of the study,

, ""The blood-brain barrier has been a persistent obstacle to delivering valuable therapies to treat disease such as tumors. We are encouraged that we were able to temporarily open this barrier in a patient to deliver chemotherapy directly to the brain tumor.""

The new process works by delivering a combination of microscopic bubbles and chemotherapy drugs into the bloodstream. The bubbles travel safely through the circulatory system and are guided by MRItoward blood vessels near the blood-brain barrier—and targeted tumor.

Once in place, low-frequency ultrasound constantly contracts and expands the bubbles. This causes them to vibrate, which loosens the cells of the blood-brain barrier and creates an opening so the drugs can travel where needed.

Afterwards, part of the tumor and adjacent tissue were removed to determine the amount of chemotherapy that was able to penetrate the area.

Researchers say the procedure could benefit not only cancer patients, but also those with Alzheimer's and certain psychiatric issues.",Scientists at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre have developed a method to more effectively deliver chemotherapy to brain tumors by non-invasively permeating the blood-brain barrier.

105,"Consumer Reports recommends following these seven spending rules to avoid breaking the bank this holiday season:

1. Thou shalt manage receipts. You might need them for proof of purchase for warranties or to make a return. Have a designated place to unload paper receipts after a day of shopping, such as an envelope in a kitchen drawer. For online purchases, save receipts and confirmation e-mails in a computer folder. If you give gift receipts, tell recipients the value, so they get a fair exchange. If you give a gift card, provide the receipt. It will be needed to replace a lost or stolen card.

2. Thou shalt use credit cards. Credit cards provide top fraud protection, and if your credit card is a rewards card, you get rebates and other goodies. Be strategic. Some cards offer extra points or cash back at different times. For instance, from October through December, the Chase Freedom card offers 5 percent back on up to $1,500 in purchases from Amazon.com, Zappos.com, and select department stores.

3. Thou shalt keep track of rebates. Plan carefully if you’re counting on rebates on anything you give as a gift. You’ll probably need to submit the UPC symbol, which could be a problem if the recipient takes or destroys the packaging. If you apply for the rebate before you give the gift, you risk losing your right to return the item. Figure out what you need to do ahead of time.

Make a list of rebate-eligible gifts and filing deadlines. For example, to obtain a $30 Visa prepaid card after purchasing a Kitchen Aid Diamond blender, you must buy the product by Dec. 31 and send the completed rebate form, UPC code, and a copy of the receipt by Jan. 31.

4. Thou shalt not take on debt. Make a budget and stick to it. Don’t be enticed by retailer special offers that provide no-interest financing for a year or more. There’s no guarantee you’ll be able to repay all you owe by the deadline. If you can’t, you’ll have to pay back the interest that has accrued during the “interest free” period.

5. Thou shalt not fall victim to the hype. Just because it’s Black Friday or an item is 50 percent off doesn’t mean it’s a top deal. In a 2011 study, a price prediction website found that more than a quarter of TVs and cameras recommended by Consumer Reports were at least 5 percent cheaper after Black Friday weekend. Don’t assume you get the best deals by buying at a particular time or event.

6. Thou shalt not become a target. Avoid theft by withdrawing cash only from ATMs in public places or inside your bank. Avoid giving your e-mail address or phone number to walk-in stores unless you welcome incessant marketing. Check out as a guest when shopping online. If the online retailer asks you to check a box indicating you want them to retain your credit card info, don’t do it. Investigate retailers you’re unfamiliar with by searching the Web and looking for a Better Business Bureau reports. Read sites’ privacy policies and terms of service.

7. Thou shalt not give gift cards. Though federal gift card protections have improved, gift cards remain a hassle. Store cards can be used only at the issuing retailer and might be nonrefundable if they’re lost or stolen, as with Red Lobster and Olive Garden gift cards. Bank cards usually have fees. Simon Mall Visa gift cards cost $5.95 to purchase and charge $2.95 monthly if a balance remains after 13 months.

The rant follows West’s absence at the Grammy’s, where he had hoped to win Album of the Year for “The Life of Pablo” without ever earning a nomination. On Sunday, he tweeted that, ""I'm practicing my Grammy speech. I'm not going to the Grammys unless they promise me Album of the Year!!!""

JUSTIN BRINGS ADORABLE DATE TO GRAMMYS

He released his latest studio album just two days before the awards show.

The coveted award went to Taylor Swift instead, whom West famously interrupted at the 2009 VMAs when the pop starlet accepted best video award for “You Belong With Me.”

None of West’s 26 tweets early Tuesday addressed the Grammy’s results nor Swift’s acceptance speech, which alluded to their ongoing feud.

LEGEND, LOVATO, AND MORE PLAY TRIBUTE TO LIONEL RITCHIE

He signed off by saying “all positive energy” just after midnight in California.

Since his delayed album’s release, West has repeatedly name-dropped the subscription-based service Tidal as the only way to hear the record for now.

The sales pitch coincides with West’s account of building debt dating back at least 13 years when the budding rapper hustled demos while working on “The College Dropout,” he revealed on Twitter.

West initially disclosed an accumulated debt of $16 million while brokering his fashion line, he revealed in February 2015. That debt exploded to a whopping $53 million at some point during the past 12 months.

“My dreams brought me into debt,” West said, but he is also noted his fashion deal with Adidas is bringing him “close to seeing the light of day.”

“Adidas has really made all the difference,” he added.

The shoes he designed for Adidas, Yeezy Boost 350, sold out within hours of going on sale. West hopes the success will lead to a bigger deal with the athletic sportswear company.

Baron Matson represented himself at a hearing in the Federal Court in Brisbane on Thursday, where he's trying to halt extradition proceedings against him.

He's facing accusations such as conspiring to commit mail fraud over an investment scheme, which involved horse-racing programs, allegedly run by him and his father Roger from 1997 to at least January 2001.

But he claimed there had been a conspiracy to deliberately delay his arrest, given investigations had been under way since 2000 and raids were conducted by the Australian Federal Police in 2005.

Matson argued the delay was a tactic to ""bolster"" a weak prosecution case against him in the foreign country.

He told the court the extradition process between the two countries was ""straightforward (and) well-established"", suggesting the drawn-out nature of his own matter was a ""breach of my fundamental rights"".

But Mark McKechnie, on behalf of the US, told Justice Darryl Rangiah the warrant had been provided and it was not the court's role to make rulings on other material.

""It's outside the ambit of the extradition for proceedings such as these to make determinations that should be made by the courts in Florida,"" he said.

The row comes as a debate about the wearing of the burkini reached fever pitch.

About 30 towns have banned the burkini from their beaches, with some mayors linking the bans to the massacre of 84 people in the southern French town of Nice last month.

It was on Nice's famous seafront promenade that a jihadist ploughed a 19-tonne truck into a massive crowd celebrating Bastille Day on July 14, killing the 84 and wounding more than 400 other people.

Some town mayors have vowed to maintain their burkini ban despite a ruling by France's highest administrative court that the prohibitions are unconstitutional.

President Barack Obama announced a proposal Thursday to provide two years of free community-college tuition to American students who maintain good grades.

“Put simply, what I’d like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everyone who’s willing to work for it,” Obama said in a video filmed Wednesday aboard Air Force One and posted to Facebook. He made the announcement as part of his pre–State of the Union tour and will formally lay out the proposal Friday in a speech in Tennessee.

The White House estimated it would save the average community-college student $3,800 annually and said it could benefit 9 million if fully realized.

White House domestic-policy director Cecilia Muñoz said the proposal is a federal-state partnership, with federal funding covering 75% of the tuitions and participating states will be expected to pick up the rest of the tab. Muñoz said legislation would be needed to approve the plan and repeatedly declined to say how much it would cost, saying more details about the funding source would come in the President’s budget for the next fiscal year due next month.

“This is a moment that is equivalent to the moment when we made high school universal,” Muñoz added.

The proposal would undoubtedly face opposition from the new Republican-controlled Congress. Muñoz did not say how the President hoped to pass the legislation through Congress, adding the White House had yet to run it by lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

In a statement, Cory Fritz, a spokesman for Speaker of the House John Boehner, said, “With no details or information on the cost, this seems more like a talking point than a plan.”","The White House says it could save the average community college student $3,800 a year",Generated Summary: President Obama announced a proposal Thursday to provide two years of free community college tuition to American students who maintain good grades.
118,"Automakers reported a 5.5 percent rise in U.S. sales in August from a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales rose to 17.53 million vehicles from 15.94 million a year earlier.

The annualized rate is followed by economists and is calculated using seasonal factors supplied by the U.S. Commerce Department that account for sales from vehicles produced in North America or overseas.

This is breaking news. Please check back for updates.

U.S. August auto sales were the highest for that month in more than a decade, thanks in part to heavy discounting by the manufacturers and a strong Labor Day weekend close, with the industry selling at an annualized pace not seen since early 2006.

All the major manufacturers except General Motors reported year-to-year increases, handily topping analysts' expectations.

August sales rose 5.4 percent from a year ago to 1,583,476 vehicles, according to a Reuters analysis. It is the highest total for the month since the industry sold 1.63 million in August 2003.

Read MoreLeasing hits high in hunt for low payments

GM held on to the top spot, while Toyota Motor edged Ford Motor for the second straight month.

The lowest gasoline prices in four years helped GM and Chrysler Group, a unit of Fiat SpA, achieve double-digit gains in sales of full-size pickups, which provide the bulk of profit. But sales of Ford's industry-leading F-Series pickups fell as the automaker began the changeover to an all-new aluminum-bodied version.

With nearly all automakers reporting August sales by midday on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the industry's seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate last month was a higher-than-expected 17.3 million vehicles, well above the 16.6 million forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. It was the highest rate since 17.6 million in January 2006, according to research firm Autodata.

Auto sales are an early indicator of consumer demand as the industry accounts for one-fifth of all U.S. retail spending.

GM sales fell 1.2 percent to 272,423 vehicles; analysts had expected 272,734. Toyota was up 6.3 percent to 246,100, beating the forecast of 225,973. Ford was up 0.4 percent to 222,174, against the expectation of 216,991.

Chrysler showed a 20 percent gain, to 198,379, compared with a forecast of 185,072, while Nissan Motor was up 11.5 percent to 134,388, versus an expectation of 123,855. Honda Motor climbed 0.4 percent to 167,038, compared with 152,191. Hyundai Group sales, including Kia, rose 5.5 percent to 124,670, compared with a forecast of 117,765.

Incentive spending by the industry last month climbed from a year ago, to an average $2,772 per vehicle, but declined slightly from July, according to research firm TrueCar.com. Virtually all major automakers except Nissan boosted discounts from a year ago.

Research firm Edmunds.com said August sales were helped by a higher percentage of zero-interest dealer-financed loans.

Transaction prices in August averaged $32,495, driven by strong sales of pickups and full-size SUVs, according to research firm Kelley Blue Book.

Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Motors in Southern California, said one surprise for dealers is ""that SUVs have really taken off again.""

Larry Dominique, an executive at TrueCar, said the shift in demand from sedans to SUVs and crossovers is forcing manufacturers to hike discounts on sedans.","August auto sales were the highest for that month in more than a decade, with the industry selling at an annualized pace not seen since early 2006.",Generated Summary: Automakers reported a 5.
119,"The FBI in New York City has undisclosed probes into about 30 suspected insider trading schemes, the agency said, in a sign investigators remains focused on building cases despite a court ruling that could curtail such prosecutions.

The number of probes, which has not been previously reported, comes amid a resurgence of insider trading cases, with prosecutors in Manhattan charging 11 people so far in 2016, up from just four in 2015.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New York office has about 50 ongoing insider trading investigations, about 30 of which have yet to result in publicly-filed charges, a spokeswoman for the agency said last week.

The probes follow a 2014 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that authorities have said could allow some individuals to avoid prosecution and that has already led to charges being dropped or reversed for 14 defendants.

John Casale, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s complex financial crimes unit in New York, acknowledged the ruling could prevent some people from being charged in certain circumstances.

But he said his agents have not had to close any non-public investigations as a result of the ruling, which reversed the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson.

That decision said that to prove insider trading, prosecutors must establish that a trader knew the tipper received something in exchange for the tip, like a quid pro quo involving money, and that the benefit was of “some consequence.”

The court rejected the proposition that merely a friendship could constitute a benefit to the tipper. As a result, Casale said agents are increasingly focused on showing the tipper received a monetary or other tangible benefit.

“There’s never been a slowdown in our process of thinking about cases,” Casale said in an interview last week. “This was a hurdle we had to overcome.”

It is unclear whether the FBI and prosecutors will be able to ultimately bring charges in those 30 undisclosed investigations. Such probes can often be closed without charges being brought.

The FBI would not comment on the details of the undisclosed probes and did not provide information on how advanced they were. Casale said some involved multiple individuals.

The law of insider trading meanwhile remains in flux. The U.S. Supreme Court in January agreed to review an appellate ruling out of California, and could use that case to clarify the definition of insider trading.

The FBI has been pursuing insider trading cases with, among others, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office has since 2009 announced charges against 107 people, and secured convictions of 81 individuals.

Those charged this year include famed Las Vegas sports gambler William “Billy” Walters, who has pleaded not guilty, and hedge fund manager Sanjay Valvani, who worked at Visium Asset Management LP and committed suicide last month following his indictment.

Casale said he was optimistic that the FBI’s undisclosed probes would result in more individuals being charged, despite the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court’s ruling. Still, he acknowledged that the decision posed additional hurdles.

“It may take more stones to overturn than it would have in the past,” he said.",That's a big increase on previous years,"Generated Summary: The FBI in New York City has undisclosed probes into about 30 suspected insider trading schemes, the agency said, in a sign investigators remains focused on building cases despite a court ruling that could curtail such prosecutions."
120,"Not shipmates...Ham (left) addresses the faithful at the opening of the ark. Nye (pictured in 2015) went to have a look. (AAP)

An outspoken celebrity scientist has crossed the gangway of one of the most famous flights of fancy in all of Christendom – a full-scale Noah's Ark now open for business in America's Deep South.

TV presenter, boffin and avowed anti-Creationist Bill Nye ""the Science Guy"" came face to face with his polar opposite, Ken Ham, at the freshly-opened ""Ark Experience "" in Frankfort, Kentucky last week.

According to Aussie expat and curator of the Cincinnati Creationist museum Mr Ham, Nye wasn't particularly impressed by the $132m erection.

""Bill challenged me about the content of many of our exhibits, and I challenged him about what he claimed and what he believed,"" Ham reported on Facebook .

One bone of contention between the pair was no doubt the mechanical animal exhibits featured in the 155m-long ark's hull, which include dinosaurs. That's because the Answers in Genesis ministry, of which Ham is the president, believes the world is no more than 6000 years old.

""It was a clash of world views,"" Ham said in the social media post.

It's not the first time his and Nye's world views have clashed. In 2014 the pair agreed to a public debate at the Creation Museum, which was held in front of a packed house and viewed by millions around the world.

""I held strongly to the view that it was an opportunity to expose the well-intending Ken Ham and the support he receives from his followers as being bad for Kentucky, bad for science education, bad for the US, and thereby bad for humankind,"" Nye said of the event, and it looks as if there's been nary a trickle under the bridge since then.

""I publicly prayed for Bill,"" Ham wrote of Nye's trip to the ark. ""I did ask him if we could be friends, but he said we could be acquaintances with mutual respect, but not friends.""

In addition to the disagreement between scientists and Creationists, the ark's construction has stirred up ill-feeling among Kentuckians who feel the government-funding of the project crosses a boundary.

""It’s a clear violation of separation of church and state,"" local man Jim Helton said, referring to sales tax incentives worth tens of millions granted to Answers in Genesis earlier this year.

""What they’re doing is utterly ridiculous and anywhere else, I don’t think it would be allowed … Basically, this boat is a church raising scientifically illiterate children and lying to them about science,"" Helton told News Observer.

For the triumphant Ham, however, those details matter not now that his dream is finally afloat.

""I believe this is going to be one of the greatest Christian outreaches of this era in history,"" he said.

""People are going to come from all over the world.""

121,"It turns out those much-mocked Ice Bucket Challenge videos helped do a lot of good.

Two summers ago, the challenge, designed to raise money for research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, took the internet by storm. Supporters ended up raising over $115 million for the A.L.S. Association.

Over two years, money from the challenge has helped fund the research and development of treatment drugs and has been used as prize money to entice people to design technology for people living with the disease, which causes a rapid breakdown in a person’s ability to control muscle movement.

The association released a chart last year showing where the funds went:

• $77 million, or 67 percent, went to research.

• $23 million, or 20 percent, went to patient and community services.

• $10 million, or 9 percent, went to public and professional education.

• $3 million, or 2 percent, went to fund-raising.

• And $2 million, roughly another 2 percent, went to payment processing fees.

The latest development, announced by the association this week, falls into the research category: It’s the discovery of NEK1, which scientists say is among the most common genes that contribute to the disease and is associated with 3 percent of A.L.S. cases. The discovery, published in Nature Genetics, is the result of a global gene-sequencing effort involving 11 countries and 80 researchers, called Project MinE.

The challenge money allowed the association to invest $1 million in Project MinE, and “initiated the U.S. arm of this international effort,” Carrie Munk, a spokeswoman for the association, said.

The discovery of NEK1 is significant but is not a breakthrough — some 30 genes tied to the disease have already been identified — according to Brian Frederick, executive vice president for communications and development for the A.L.S. Association.

Mr. Frederick said that the discovery of the gene could eventually mean that “treatments won’t be limited to one subset of people with A.L.S., but that it might be a more broad group.”

The movement took the internet by storm in July 2014, and many supporters trace the tipping point to a video posted by Pete Frates, a former college baseball player who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012. Others followed suit, including celebrities from Mark Zuckerberg to Lena Dunham, who consented to having a bucket of water dumped over their heads for a good cause.

The challenge spread as wildly as it did because the premise involved people reaching out to each other on social media with a simple request: Film yourself getting water dumped over your head or donate money to A.L.S. research. Many did both, but critics disparaged the movement as “slacktivism” or an outright racket. A.L.S. awareness activists, however, say that the challenge reinvigorated a research community that was lacking attention and funds to produce scientific advancements.

“There’s an excitement and an energy in the A.L.S. research community that has not been there before,” Mr. Frederick said, adding: “There’s a real sense of hope and optimism among many people living with A.L.S. now.”",A social media campaign disparaged by some as “slacktivism” raised $115 million and encouraged research.,Generated Summary: It turns out those much-mocked Ice Bucket Challenge videos helped do a lot of good.

123,"A Syrian man wanted for allegedly preparing a bombing attack in Germany was apprehended by three of his countrymen, who overpowered him, tied him up in their apartment, and then alerted police.

The arrest of Jaber Albakr on Monday night ended a near two-day nationwide search for the 22-year-old that German authorities launched after finding several kilograms of explosives and components hidden inside an apartment in the eastern city of Chemnitz on Saturday.

Albakr arrived in Germany amid a flood of 890,000 asylum seekers last year. Saxony criminal police chief Joerg Michaelis says that the three Syrians who captured him recognised the suspect from wanted posters police posted online as part of the manhunt.

After taking him to their apartment late Sunday night, two of the Syrians bound and held Albakr while the third brought a photo of Albakr to a local police station, leading to the arrest early Monday, Michaelis said.

Prosecutors and police said on Monday they considered Albakr an extremist with likely links to the Islamic State group. Germany's domestic intelligence agency had been watching him since September and alerted Saxony authorities about his alleged possible plot on Friday, authorities said.

When police raided the apartment in the city of Chemnitz where he was thought to be staying on Saturday, Albakr was able to flee. Inside the apartment they found 1.5kgs ""extremely dangerous explosives'' and components, according to federal prosecutors.

Michaelis said at this stage of the investigation ""the behaviour and actions of the suspect currently speak for an IS context.'' He didn't elaborate.

A security official said there was no indication yet that Albakr was being directed by the Islamic State group, but investigators are still checking evidence.

Police said it was not clear when and how the suspect met up with his three countrymen in Leipzig, about 80kms from Chemnitz, or if they already knew him.

They would not release any further information about the three Syrians who apprehended Albakr. If the signs of his having an extremist background were substantiated, ""the people who gave the tip are of course in danger,'' the police chief said.

German prosecutors say they they had no indications that an attack target had been chosen.

(The margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.) On Sunday, Clinton’s opponent Bernie Sanders told CNN “the vast majority of my voters will vote for her” if she works to “embrace” some of his policy positions. The Vermont Senator, who has not officially suspended his campaign, has said he will vote for Clinton.

In another national poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, Clinton is ahead of Trump by just 5 points. Forty-six percent of registered voters support Clinton, while 41% support Trump, according to this poll, conducted from June 19 to June 23 among 1,000 registered voters. It has a margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.

A mother who is an Anglican priest says her church showed no compassion once she reported her son had been abused by a man training to be a priest.

The woman, using the pseudonym CKR, said Bruce Hoare, archdeacon in charge of ordinations at Morpeth College near Maitland, laughed when she told him a 28-year-old theology student had given her 13-year-old son a wind-up figurine of a man thrusting his penis into a sheep.

And she said Bishop Roger Herft, now Archbishop of Perth, ""berated"" her when she complained the diocese had not recorded her son's sex assault complaint against the trainee priest.

CKR's son CKU also gave evidence at a royal commission on Thursday and said he reported to police in 2002 about being groomed, shown pornography, molested and hounded by Ian Barrack when he lived with his mother at St John's College in Morpeth in 1997.

Morpeth College was a seminary where Anglican clergy trained and has been referred to at the commission as ""Satan's Playground"" because of the high number of pedophile priests who studied there.

Barrack was jailed for two years in 2005. CKR said from the time she went to then archdeacon Hoare with the complaint about the offensive toy she was treated badly within the diocese.

She said Hoare, later defrocked for having group sex with a teenage boy, did not seem to find the toy offensive and only changed his demeanour when she expressed her ""revulsion at a toy showing an act of bestiality"".

He told her he would show it to Bishop Herft and later gave her back the toy and told her to return it to Barrack.

CKR again went to Mr Hoare when in 2002 CKU disclosed the full extent of the abuse by the trainee priest.

She had meetings with Bishop Herft, someone from DoCS and a policeman and assumed the matter would be pursued through the diocesan professional standards process.

CKR learned in 2003 from a woman chairing the committee dealing with sex abuse allegations no record of her son's complaint had been made.

She was also told that Bruce Hockman, the diocese's business manager, had said at a meeting with Bishop Herft and other senior officials ""Oh, we don't have to worry about this case. It's not going to get to court."" The diocese later sent her son $2000 as a gift when they heard he was going to travel overseas.

CKR took civil action which took years to settle.

""Throughout the entire ordeal I have felt that the Church has never acted fairly, compassionately or pastorally"", she said.

CKR said from the time her ex-husband, also a priest, studied at Morpeth in 1979-1981 there were rumours of sexual activity including that some of the would-be priests preferred young boys.

On Monday solicitor Keith Allen, former trustee and member or the diocesan council in Newcastle, will continue evidence he started on Friday.

U.S. housing starts rose less than expected in March and building permits fell, pointing to underlying weakness in the housing market that could persist despite better weather.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday groundbreaking increased 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 946,000.

February's starts were revised to show a 1.9 percent rise rather than the previously reported 0.2 percent fall. Economists polled by Reuters had expected starts to rise to a 973,000-unit rate last month.

While a brutally cold winter weighed on home building in December and January, activity has also been hampered by shortages of building lots and skilled labor as well as rising prices for materials.

A report on Tuesday showed homebuilders in April were still downbeat about the sector's near-term prospects. The housing market is under strain from higher mortgage rates and elevated house prices that are sidelining potential buyers.

129,"The immigration minister took too long in deciding the citizenship applications of two former Afghan refugees and Peter Dutton must now reconsider his refusals to both men, the Federal Court says.

One of the men waited 18 months and the other 23 months, before turning to the Federal Court to argue they'd endured excessive delays in finding out whether their applications had been accepted or rejected.

In a landmark ruling handed down on Friday, the court found both men had suffered unreasonable delays, and ordered that the eventual decisions to deny both men citizenship must be quashed and reconsidered.

The Hazara men fled persecution in Afghanistan before arriving in Australia by boat in 2010, where both were granted permanent protection visas as refugees.

They qualified for Australian citizenship by living in the community for four years before passing citizenship tests.

But despite passing their tests in 2014 and 2015 respectively, neither received a citizenship ceremony.

The Immigration Department's service standard for processing citizenship applications is 80 days.

Justice Mordecai Bromberg said there was no explanation as to why applications by the men, referred to by the initials F and G, sat in a ""complex cases"" queue while vast numbers of others were processed.

""I am not able to exclude the real possibility that for a very substantial period of time, F and G's applications were simply left aside and forgotten,"" Justice Bromberg said.

The court's decision gave hope to thousands of others whose citizenship applications were ""put in the bottom drawer"" by a department dragging its feet, the Refugee Council of Australia said.

""Our government has denied them basic rights to stability and, importantly, family reunion, through slow and targeted decision-making,"" RCOA acting chief executive Tim O'Connor said.

""Today's ruling recognises this injustice and represents a first step towards a resolution for thousands and a chance for them to start to rebuild their lives.""","The immigration minister unreasonably delayed decisions on two citizenship applications and must reconsider both cases, the Federal Court has ruled.","Generated Summary: The immigration minister took too long in deciding the citizenship applications of two former Afghan refugees and Peter Dutton must now reconsider his refusals to both men, the Federal Court says."
130,"Hyundai introduced the 2013 three-row Santa Fe crossover utility vehicle at the L.A. Auto Show Wednesday along with the Veloster C3 Roll Top, a California-themed concept car.

The new six/seven-passenger Santa Fe will join Hyundai's two-row Santa Fe Sport, which went on sale in August. The newly announced Santa Fe is 8.5 inches longer and is also slightly taller and wider than the Santa Fe Sport.

The three-row Santa Fe offers 1.9-inches of additional leg room for the vehicle's second row of seats -- which are available in captain's chairs if desired.

PHOTOS: Highlights from the 2012 L.A. Auto Show

The Santa Fe looks similar to the Santa Fe Sport, but one of the most noticeable differences between the two vehicles is the rear side windows, which are larger on the Santa Fe to accommodate its third-row passengers.

The larger crossover runs on a 3.3-liter GDI V6 engine that can get 290 horsepower and 252 pound-feet of torque. It has a towing rate of up to 5,000 pounds.

The South Korean automaker said pricing for the vehicle will be announced early next year, closer to the three-row Santa Fe's on-sale date.

Hyundai also unveiled the Veloster C3 Roll Top, a three-door convertible coupe concept. As noted in the name, the Veloster C3 Roll Top features a canvas roof that can open toward the front or back of the car to accommodate bicycles or surf boards.

At the show, the Veloster C3 Roll Top was loaded with a bicycle, with its back wheel standing on the coupe's tailgate and its handle bars towering through the roll top above the car's roof. Not letting up on the California theme, Hyundai also outfitted the Veloster C3 Roll Top with teal-colored rear wheels and a cargo floor made out of repurposed skateboard parts.

131,"FORTUNE — The media industry has been lobbying Washington since before the Silent Film Era. The tech and Internet industries, which are increasingly pitted against Hollywood and the music business (mainly over piracy) have been slower to establish themselves on K Street.

That’s been changing in recent years, and today marks the launch of the Internet Association, banding together such companies as Facebook FB , Google GOOG , Amazon AMZN , eBay EBAY and several others to fight for what it calls “a free and innovative Internet.”

There are good reasons for the industry’s initial reluctance to plant a foothold in Washington: the commercial Internet was created largely by fast-moving, fast-growing companies often run by technolibertarian types and financed by venture capitalists who by and large felt no need for Washington’s help and no desire to entangle themselves in politics. Unlike many new industries in earlier times, information technology and the Internet grew during a long period of deregulation, and government mostly left those industries alone (with certain notable exceptions.)

That’s changing, with government now taking on issues such as intellectual property, antitrust, and taxation. At the same time, Silicon Valley — in particular, the Internet industry — has finally learned that it must counter the media industry’s formidable political power with some power of its own.

Intellectual property is the new group’s main concern, at least for the moment. Silicon Valley was spooked by the attempts to pass the Stop Online Privacy Act (or SOPA, in the House) and the Protect IP Act (or PIPA, in the Senate). Those bills were basically shouted down early this year by a public led by various interest groups. But it was considered a near-miss by a Hollywood that seems intent on imposing highly restrictive rules on Internet traffic through its dubious effort to fight piracy.

The group calls itself “an umbrella public policy organization dedicated to strengthening and protecting a free and innovative Internet.” The association’s CEO, Michael Beckerman said in a statement that the member companies “are all fierce competitors in the marketplace” that nevertheless “recognize the Internet needs a unified voice in Washington.” The “future of the Internet is at stake,” he said. Beckerman is a former staffer for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Internet and telecommunications policy.

The other companies in the group are: AOL AOL , Expedia EXPE , IAC IACI , LinkedIn LNKD , Monster Worldwide LNKD , Rackspace RAX , salesforce.com,TripAdvisor TRIP , Yahoo YHOO and Zynga ZNGA . Notably absent are Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT .","In the face of  Hollywood's lobbying might, the Internet industry has no choice but to strengthen its own hand in Washington.","Generated Summary: FORTUNE -- The media industry has been lobbying Washington since before the Silent Film Era.

132,"While fast-food workers across the country plan protests over their wages later this month, employees at McDonald’s-owned restaurants can expect pay hikes starting this summer.

The fast-food giant will raise the average hourly rate for workers at the U.S. restaurants it owns to $9.90 from $9.01 starting July 1, while those average wages will climb above $10 per hour by the end of 2016, McDonald’s announced Wednesday. The company will also allow those employees to earn up to five days of paid vacation every year following one year of employment.

One catch is that the new wages will not apply to fast-food workers employed by McDonald’s MCD franchisees, which account for nearly 90% of the company’s U.S. restaurant employees. As it stands, roughly 90,000 McDonald’s workers will see a pay increase starting this summer. The company’s 3,100 franchisees are able to set their own policies when it comes to wages and benefits, McDonald’s said Wednesday.

U.S. fast-food workers are planning a one-day strike as part of a two-year campaign that seeks a $15 hourly wage as well as the right to unionize. Those protests are planned for April 15.

The wage hikes also come one month after Steve Easterbrook took over as McDonald’s CEO following the departure of Don Thompson.

He said such a combination would have synergy: Time Warner has Warner Bros. Pictures, while CBS has no movie studio. The companies could also fit well together in sports and news.

""It should get done. It's hard to find good reasons to stop it, and I believe at the end of the day it's not anticompetitive. I don't believe that there is any monopoly they're going to have. I don't think it's going to be harmful and I think that the competition doesn't like it,"" he said.

134,"Confidence might be more than just an emotion. A new study published in the journal Neuron suggests that it may actually be a measurable brain activity.

Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) looked at rats, critters that exhibit confidence similarly to humans by their willingness to wait longer for a reward when they feel confident they made the right decision, they say. They were able to determine the part of the brain behind that confidence.

The researchers trained the rats to respond to two different odors that were associated with two different doors, and behind one of the doors was a reward. Then the researchers mixed the two odors, but made sure one scent was dominant. The goal was for the rat to choose the right door based on the dominant odor. They found that the rats exhibited confidence by their willingness to wait longer for the correct door to open. “Rats are willing to ‘gamble’ with their time. This is something that we can measure and create mathematical models to explain,” said study author Adam Kepecs of CSHL in a statement. “The time rats are willing to wait predicts the likelihood of correct decisions and provides an objective measure tracking the feeling of confidence.”

In the second part of their experiment, the researchers looked at the part of the brain called the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which prior studies have suggested could play a role in confidence. When researchers shut off the neurons in the OFC, they discovered that the rats’ wait times were no longer a predictor of making the right choice, suggesting that their confidence had been impaired.

The human OFC is more sophisticated, but it plays the same role as it does in rats, researchers think.

But a former High Court judge who argues there's little point in a public vote and instead wants parliament to get on with its job has the backing of Labor.

Michael Kirby, who has lived with his partner Johan since 1969, hopes the Senate will deny support for what he believes is an unnecessary and expensive exercise.

In a 10-point take-down of the plan, Mr Kirby says a plebiscite defeated would effectively kill off the reform, possibly for decades.

He believes Australia's record on successful constitutional referendums is abysmal and there is no reason to hope this vote, proposed to be held next year, would be an exception to the rule.

""It would be better that nothing at all were done by the federal parliament on same-sex marriage than that a plebiscite was undertaken with a possibility of defeat,"" Mr Kirby writes in The Australian on Tuesday.

He's got the backing of the federal opposition, which reckons he's right in arguing it's been almost a century since Australia held a plebiscite on a policy issue.

137,"Harvard University said Thursday that it recruited a veteran investment manager from rival Columbia University to take over its struggling endowment.

The Cambridge school named N.P. “Narv” Narvekar chief executive of its $35.7 billion fund, the largest endowment in the higher education world. Narvekar, 54, has run the $9.6 billion Columbia endowment since 2002. He’ll take the reins at Harvard on Dec. 5.

Harvard’s endowment, once the envy of the academic world, has scuffled in recent years. On Narvekar’s watch, Columbia produced an annualized return of 10.1 percent over the 10 years through June 2015, Harvard said. Harvard’s gain over that period was 7.6 percent.

After a 2 percent loss in 2016, Harvard’s 10-year return has slumped to 5.7 percent. Columbia has not yet released its return for the most recent fiscal year, a challenging period for most endowments, though its assets have dipped.

Harvard’s investing model may be under fresh scrutiny with the new boss. Unlike most of its rivals, Harvard has a large staff of more than 200 and manages about 40 percent of its money internally. Most schools hire outside firms to manage their money. At Columbia, Narvekar oversaw a staff of 20.

“Narv is a highly successful endowment manager with an outstanding 14-year track record heading a large endowment, providing steady leadership and delivering strong returns,” Paul Finnegan, chairman of Boston-based Harvard Management, the school’s investment arm, said in a statement.

The board has been under pressure to find a permanent chief executive for the endowment since July, when Stephen Blyth stepped down after a brief and unexplained medical leave. Blyth had held the job for just a year-and-a-half. Narvekar will be the endowment’s fourth CEO in 10 years.

Before Columbia, Narvekar worked in the investment office at the University of Pennsylvania, where he had earned his MBA at the Wharton School in 1991. Prior to joining the endowment world, Narvekar worked for Wall Street’s J.P. Morgan for 14 years, ultimately rising to the position of managing director for equity derivatives.

In a statement, Narvekar said, “It is an honor to join such a prestigious investment organization and help support the mission of Harvard University.” He also said HMC has an “unparalleled investment platform among endowments.”

At the University of Pennsylvania, Narvekar was focused on building hedge fund and private equity portolios. Among the boards he currently serves on, he is a member of the Soros Foundations Investment Committee.

Narvekar grew up in Chevy Chase, Md., and attended Haverford College in Pennsylvania, where he majored in economics.

Harvard University president Drew Faust, who has expressed concern over Harvard’s lagging investment results, in a statement said, “We are pleased to welcome Narv to Harvard and are confident that his leadership skills and deep experience at the highest levels of investment management will position HMC for long-term success.”

Wall Street bond rating agency S&P Global Ratings on Thursday affirmed Harvard’s AAA rating on roughly $5 billion in debt, citing “significant cash and investments compared with outstanding debt.”

Harvard has cut its debt down from a high of $6.3 billion in 2011, after investment losses in the financial crisis.

A staff member anonymously contacted the Transport Department warning of the ""disastrous situation"" in October 2015 when Ms Trad was the responsible minister, the Seven Network has reported.

The network's Right to Information request revealed the staff member warned there was a large number of services without the necessary drivers.

They also highlighted the disbanding of a training section, a blowout in training times, a lack of training staff and a bulk retirement of experienced drivers.

""There will be major damage: massive cancellations,"" notes from the call said.

The notes were reportedly forwarded to two senior advisors of Ms Trad, but the department ruled that no further information was required.

It has previously been revealed current Transport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe's department was warned of the looming problems in March.

""It's unforgivable that not one but two ... transport ministers could have prevented the timetable debacle but chose to do nothing,"" opposition transport spokesman Andrew Powell said.

""It's an insult to Queenslanders and quite frankly, it's bad governance.""

A spokeswoman for Ms Trad said following the anonymous call, a Queensland Rail briefing informed both Ms Trad and Treasurer Curtis Pitt 100 new drivers and 100 new guards were being recruited.

This was to meet the requirements of projects like the Moreton Bail Rail Link, the opening of which triggered a major timetable meltdown in October when widespread service cancellations caused commuter chaos.

""At no stage did Queensland Rail (QR) provide any advice to the Deputy Premier that train crew availability was a risk to the opening of the new Moreton Bay Rail Link,"" the spokeswoman said.

When Adidas wanted to create a mural to illustrate the launch of its new football boot last year, it turned to ""professional graffiti artist"" Darren Cullen for help. Cullen, 38, runs a firm providing spraycan artwork and branding to major international companies, and says he has never painted illegally on a wall or train.

But despite having worked with one of the Games's major sponsors, on Tuesday Cullen was arrested by British Transport Police (BTP) and barred from coming within a mile of any Olympic venue, as part of a pre-emptive sweep against a number of alleged graffiti artists before the Olympics.

BTP confirmed that four men from Kent, London and Surrey, aged between 18 and 38, had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage, two of whom were also further arrested on suspicion of incitement to commit criminal damage.

They were bailed until November under strict conditions restricting their access to rail, tube and tram transport, preventing them from owning spray paint or marker pens, and ordering them not to go near any Olympic venue in London or elsewhere. None has been charged.

The arrests were in connection with ""a live and ongoing criminal investigation into linked incidents of criminal damage between January 2007 and July 2012"", said a BTP spokesman.

But Cullen, who says he has never painted illegally and whose firm Graffiti Kings has worked with major blue chip firms including Microsoft and NPower and the Royal Shakespeare Company, said he was not questioned over any alleged incidents of criminal damage.

Instead, he said, he was asked about a website he had set up two years ago on behalf of a client, frontline-magazine.co.uk. The website was ""all about the history of graffiti"", Cullen said, but did not promote it. ""I don't condone or promote illegal graffiti,"" he said. ""I always say to young people: 'Don't do it. It's no good for you.'""

The arrests come as the Metropolitan police's strategy of halting potential disruptive action in advance of major public events was given high court endorsement. The tactic is a key plank of police planning to ensure the Games are not disrupted.

In the high court on Wednesday, Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Openshaw ruled the police did not operate an unlawful policy by carrying out pre-emptive strikes before Prince William's wedding last year.

The judges dismissed applications for judicial review from 20 people among scores who were arrested or subjected to searches in the days before and during the wedding.

""We find nothing in the various strands of the claimants' case, whether taken individually or cumulatively, to make good the contention that the policing of the royal wedding involved an unlawful policy or practice, with an impermissibly low threshold of tolerance for public protests,"" said the judges.

Human rights activists had argued the case had major implications for the policing of other major events, including the Olympics.

In addition to his previous work for Adidas, Cullen said he was in discussions to provide artwork with another major Olympic sponsor and had been commissioned to spraypaint a London taxi to be used by a leading broadcaster at the Games. His computer equipment, phone, iPad and his son's laptop had been confiscated.

The four men's bail conditions also forbid them from entering ""any railway system, including tubes and trams, or [being] in any train, tram or tube station or in or on any other railway property not open to the public"" unless in limited circumstances including attending a written appointment with a solicitor.

They are also barred from possessing ""any spray paint, marker pens, any grout pen, etching equipment, or unset paint"".

The Global Peace Index has measured unrest and conflict throughout the world for the past eight years and have said recent assessments show a declining trend.

""We are living in the most peaceful century in human history; however the 2014 Global Peace Index shows that the last seven years has shown a notable deterioration in levels of peace,"" their report reads.

""The world has become less peaceful over the last year, mainly due to a rise in terrorist activity, the number of conflicts fought and the number of refugees and displaced people."" Iceland is followed by Denmark and New Zealand in the country rankings, while Europe was rated the most peaceful region on the planet.

Australia came in at number 15 for the second year running, out of 162 countries assessed.

That is the highest rank Australia has reached since the index began, the lowest being 19, in 2012.

Australia ranked well on general crime, however, the Global Peace Index rated us poorly on measures including gender diversity in government, education spending and weapon imports.

Syria was rated the most violent country, followed by Afghanistan and South Sudan.

The US was ranked at 101, while Russia's year of aggression towards its neighbours saw it relegated to 152.

142,"After years of forecasting gloom and doom for stocks only to watch them surge, Marc Faber is sounding the alarm as loud as ever.

Faber, editor of The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report, believes that stocks in the U.S. and in many places around the globe are in a central bank-fueled bubble. And while he can't put a time on when that perceived bubble will pop, he prognosticates that once it does, the outcome will be horrifying.

""For the last two years, I've been thinking that U.S. stocks are due for a correction,"" Faber said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""But I always say a bubble is a bubble, and if there's no correction, the market will go up, and one day it will go down, big time.""

""The market is in a position where it's not just going to be a 10 percent correction. Maybe it first goes up a bit further, but when it comes, it will be 30 percent or 40 percent minimum!"" Faber asserted.

A 40 percent decline from Wednesday's close would take the S&P 500 to 1,264, a level that hasn't been seen since the early days of 2012.

Faber says low yields and stimulative central bank policies around the world have led to a condition in which ""all assets are grossly overvalued … and eventually this will unwind and cause some problems.""

Despite his massively bearish call, Faber said he's ""not short the market yet,"" since he doesn't know how high stocks could go in the interim. Still, he makes clear that ""I'm not interested to buy momentum, I'm interested to buy value.""

""We've gone from day-to-day volatility to intraday volatility,"" Mark Luschini, chief market strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said.

""A progression of events caused this, in the context of a market that is scared anyway, with the VIX trading above 20,"" Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said of the market's about face.

""Copper prices are falling out of bed, down 5 percent, that tells you something about global growth, that something is not right,"" Boockvar added.

Reports from overseas that had Germany downplaying the notion of further quantitative easing by the ECB helped push the market lower, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said.

""There are rumors that Germany is botching quantitative easing, and the market is looking for QE to come out on Jan. 22. It's a non-trivial worry, when you're talking about a eurozone that in the aggregate is almost the size of the U.S. economy,"" Luschini said.

""And, there's continuation of pressure from crude prices; investors are still trying to ascertain if lower energy prices are good or bad for stocks,"" Hogan said.

KB Home led declines among homebuilders after it projected a ""significant"" drop in gross margins in the current quarter; Apple shares surged after Credit Suisse upgraded the supplier of consumer technology to outperform from neutral.

With the fourth-quarter earnings season started, investors are on the lookout for the the effect of crude's decline on the S&P 500's collective bottom line, with oil prices on Tuesday falling to near six-year lows as a major OPEC producer stuck to the cartel's decision not to reduce output.

Officers from Queensland’s environment department removed the estuarine crocodile from the near the beach in the Daintree national park where Waldron was taken on Sunday night, before killing it “humanely”.

“Wildlife officers believe the 4.3m crocodile is the target animal due to its size and location,” Queensland police said on Friday.

Related: Australian woman feared dead after being grabbed by crocodile

“The 4.3m estuarine crocodile was humanely euthanised. It is being transported to a secure facility in Cairns.”

Police wanted to examine the remains of the crocodile to determine if it was responsible for the fatal attack.

It was the second crocodile removed as part of the investigation into the death of the 46-year-old, who lived in New South Wales but was holidaying in Queensland. She was dragged underwater at Thornton beach on Sunday night after venturing into the waist-deep water with her friend Leeann Mitchell.

Police had earlier requested the remains of a 2.5m-long crocodile trapped in one of three caged devices be examined.

The animal’s stomach contents were “unidentifiable” and required further analysis. A police spokesman said investigators believed the crocodile was not the one responsible but were not able to conclusively rule it out until the results of tests were returned.

Waldron’s father, Pat, and sister flew to Cairns from New Zealand earlier this week to be closer to where she spent her final days.

They made an emotional visit to Thornton beach to say goodbye after expressing gratitude for the massive search effort.

“We need to be here and cry on the beach,” said Mr Waldron, who did not want the crocodile harmed.

“There’s signs everywhere – don’t go swimming with the crocodiles. She’d do crazy things. And what she did there is a crazy thing, absolutely.”

146,"The Northern Territory royal commission into the detention of young indigenous children could be a watershed moment for Australian justice, the lawyer for one abused boy says.

The inquiry being led by co-commissioners Margaret White and Mick Gooda sat on Tuesday to outline what would happen over the next few months.

Lawyer Peter O'Brien appeared in the ABC program which sparked the royal commission, after showing footage of youths in Darwin's Done Dale centre being gassed, stripped naked, hooded and tied to restraint chairs.

""This is a watershed moment potentially, not only in the history of detention in the NT but potentially also right across the country,"" he told reporters outside the Supreme Court in Darwin.

Mr O'Brien said the treatment of two of his clients, Dylan Voller and Jake Roper, in the system was ""deplorable"" and that they were willing to give evidence.

Mr Gooda and Ms White plan to proceed ""with a high degree of cultural competence"" to create a safe environment for people giving evidence to the commission, which will examine the treatment of juvenile offenders over 10 years.

""Many wrongs have been committed in the past which have caused great trauma and lasting damage to many people,"" he said in his opening statement on Tuesday.

""Despite being a painful process, for the community to move forward, it must come to understand where these wrongs have occurred and ensure those wrongs are not repeated.""

The commission will look at the years between August 2006 and August 2016.

""There can be no one in our community who is not anxious to find out if there are ways to bring about a significant reduction in child offending,"" Ms White said in her opening statement.

Before the commission was first announced, Mr Gooda was criticised for being biased after he called for the sacking of the now ousted NT Country Liberal Party government.

He again rejected this, assuring stakeholders of his impartiality.

""I wish to assure those people and the community that I will look only at the evidence and other information given to the commission and that nothing extraneous will affect the conclusions I reach with my co-commissioner,"" he said.

The commissioners will start hearing public evidence from next month, ahead of a final report to be delivered by the end of March 2017.

They've already visited Darwin, Alice Springs and Kalkarindji and met with more than two dozen stakeholder groups.

One of the injured guards fears he may be permanently blinded in one eye after being pelted by a rock during the mayhem.

Grant Oakland, 55, underwent an emergency operation to reattach his retina on Thursday and will require several more rounds of surgery although it looks increasingly unlikely he will regain sight in the eye.

149,"IBM’s partnership with Apple to bring business-centric applications to iOS devices continues to grow, this time with support coming for the Apple Watch.

Apple updated its website this week with new details on a variety of IBM IBM enterprise apps that can now function on Apple’s much-hyped smartwatch. The apps target the healthcare sector, field-service technicians, and public safety officials.

Using the Hospital RN app, nurses can supposedly use the Apple AAPL Watch to receive push notifications, so they can stay up-to-date about a patient’s healthcare needs. The Field Connect app will apparently send information regarding weather, power outages, or any sort of hazard that may impact a field technician’s job straight to a user’s watch.

For public safety officials, the Incident Aware app will stream urgent alerts to one’s Apple Watch. It’s easy to imagine a police officer getting a ping on his or her watch that lets them know about dangerous situations as they respond to a distress call.

The common thread for all of these apps is that they emphasize the use of push notifications. While they also offer other features, including GPS mapping for iOS devices, the small-sized screen of the Apple Watch seems to limit the amount of features IBM can pack into the apps without creating a cluttered experience.

Still, these are early days for Apple Watch development, so it makes sense that the first batch of IBM-developed features seem to act more like accessories for current iPhone or iPad apps. They don’t seem to be stand-alone features, but rather apps that work in conjunction with ones already found on a user’s iPhone or iPad to create a multi-device app experience.

As Fortune’s Stacey Higginbotham reported, the Apple Watch opens up the opportunity for a wide range of business applications. These watches have a lot more to them than just being used as fitness trackers. For example, businesses could use the smartwatches as a way to keep tabs on their employees and, from the data obtained through these devices, use it to discover patterns in how certain teams work with each other.

These latest IBM apps don’t seem to be doing anything as complex as data analytics yet, but that doesn’t mean they won’t in the future. IBM recently launched its IBM Watson Health unit that uses the company’s data processing system to analyze healthcare data, such as medical records and diagnostics.

With a smart phone app like Hospital RN that feeds important patient data to nurses, there’s a lot of opportunity for that data to be synced up to the Watson Health Cloud for data processing that may benefit health-care providers.",IBM launches business-centric applications for the Apple Watch.,"Generated Summary: IBM’s partnership with Apple to bring business-centric applications to iOS devices continues to grow, this time with support coming for the Apple Watch."

151,"Hamza El Din, an oud player and composer who reinvented the musical culture of Nubia and carried it worldwide, died Monday in Berkeley, Calif. He was 76.

Hamza El Din played the oud in 2005 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He collected Nubian songs by riding through villages on a donkey.

The cause was complications after surgery, said his wife, Nadra, who survives him.

Mr. El Din's austere, hypnotic music was based on his research into the traditions of Nubia, an ancient North African kingdom on the upper Nile, which was a cradle of civilization.

Accompanying his reedy voice with concise, incantatory phrases on the oud, Mr. El Din created a meditative music that sought a timeless purity. He performed dressed in white, with a white turban. But he was also a cosmopolitan musician who taught ethnomusicology and lived in Rome, Tokyo and California.

Hamza El Din was born in 1929 in Egypt, in what had been the territory of ancient Nubia, a crossroads of trade that flourished as early as the fourth millennium B.C. Nubia's former territory is now part of Egypt and the Sudan, and Mr. El Din's hometown, Toshka, was flooded after the building of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960's. He studied electrical engineering and worked for the national railroad in Cairo.

But he was drawn to music, first playing the round hand drum called the tar and then taking up the oud, a six-stringed lute. When he learned about the plans to build the Aswan Dam, which flooded much of ancient Nubia, he grew determined to preserve Nubian culture.

He studied Arabic music at Ibrahim Shafiq's Institute of Music and at the King Fouad Institute for Middle Eastern Music. He also traveled through villages in Egypt by donkey, collecting Nubian songs. With a grant from the Italian government, he studied Western music and classical guitar at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome.

He drew on his studies, and on surviving Nubian traditions, to create music that fused rhythms and inflections from Nubia with Arabic classical elements and a virtuosic approach to the oud, an instrument not traditionally played in Nubia. He was reimagining the music of his home.

""One day, I felt the oud had the Nubian accent,"" he said in a 1996 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle. ""I played for people in my village and they were mesmerized.""

Mr. El Din performed in 1964 at the Newport Folk Festival and recorded two albums for the folk label Vanguard in 1964 and 1965. He moved to the United States, where he was a mentor to musicians, including the guitarist and oud player Sandy Bull. He settled in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1971 his album ""Escalay (The Water Wheel)"" was released on the Nonesuch Explorer label.

Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead produced Mr. El Din's album ""Eclipse"" (Rykodisc); Mr. El Din helped arrange for the Dead to perform at the Great Pyramids in Egypt in 1978.

Mr. El Din also made albums for Lotus Records and Sounds True. His music was used for movie soundtracks and for dance pieces by the Paris Opera Ballet, Maurice Béjart Ballet and the San Francisco Ballet; and he composed music for a version of the Aeschylus play ""The Persians,"" directed by Peter Sellars at the Salzburg Festival.

He toured regularly, performing quietly intense solo concerts, and appeared at major festivals from Los Angeles to Edinburgh to Montreux.

He had stints teaching ethnomusicology at Ohio University, the University of Washington and the University of Texas. During the 1980's, with a grant from the Japan Foundation to work on a comparative study of the Arabic oud and the biwa, a Japanese plucked lute, he moved to Tokyo, where he lived until the mid-1990's.

Mr. El Din collaborated with ensembles including the Kronos Quartet, which recorded an arrangement of ""Escalay"" in 1992. When he returned to the United States, he resettled in the San Francisco Bay Area.

""I was a Nubian musician playing for my people,"" he said in the 1996 interview. ""Now I'm a Nubian musician playing those same themes for the whole world.""

His most recent album, ""A Wish"" (Sounds True), was released in 1999, but his wife said that he had recently completed recording a new album.","Hamza El Din reinvented the musical culture of Nubia, an ancient North African kingdom on the upper Nile, and carried it worldwide.","Generated Summary: Hamza El Din, an oud player and composer who reinvented the musical culture of Nubia and carried it worldwide, died Monday in Berkeley, Calif.

This month is your last chance to make charitable donations for 2013. So in between the holiday parties and cookie swaps, consider pulling out your checkbook one more time for your favorite cause.

You'll have plenty of company. Most charities report receiving about 40 percent of all their donations in December, according to a Charity Navigator poll.

Charitable giving is always ennobling, but this year there are also ways to make it as effective as possible. If you maximize your charity tax deduction, you can give more, and if you embrace novel ways of working with a charity, your generosity can also have more impact.

(Read more: It's the way you donate that counts)

Investors have several options this year for taking full advantage of the tax breaks for charitable donations.

For starters, the stock market's strength in 2013 means many investors are sitting on hefty capital gains. If you donate some of that appreciated stock to a charity, you can take a deduction for the fair market value. You also avoid paying capital gains on the stock's appreciation—a nice twofer in a year when taxpayers in the top bracket are facing a higher capital gains tax rate.

(Read more: U.S. stocks finish higher on the week)

If you are over age 70½ and receiving a required distribution from your IRA, you have another option. You can donate up to $100,000 of that amount and it will not count as income. (This tax break is due to expire at the end of the year, so if you are planning to make use of it, this is the time.)

(Read more: Going, going...a number of tax deductions set to expire)

""Defer revenue and accelerate deductions if you can, especially in high tax brackets,"" said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt. ""Rates are going to be pretty high"" in the new year.

As for how you seek out the organization that will do the most good with your donation, the landscape is shifting, according to Susan Wolff Ditkoff, co-head of the philanthropy practice at Bridgespan Group, an advisor to nonprofits and philanthropists.

""Individual donors, certainly more than 10 years ago, are going directly to the nonprofits that they care a lot about. It used to be they would go through an intermediary like the United Way,"" she said.

The Internet, of course, makes finding a charity easier. And with websites like crowdrise.com creating communities around charitable causes, you can find other like minded donors online and perhaps learn of more organizations with missions that dovetail with your charity goals, where your gift may make even more of a difference.

Ditkoff also advises a careful look at whether your charity of choice is on an upward trend.

157,"NEW YORK — Puerto Rico reduced the amount of potential losses for creditors in a revised debt-restructuring proposal as island officials seek to accelerate negotiations while the commonwealth moves closer to default and Congress considers oversight of its finances.

Puerto Rico and its advisers made public details of the offer first presented in March. General obligation and sales-tax bondholders would recover more of their investments under the latest plan. It would reduce the commonwealth’s $49.3 billion of tax-supported debt to between $32.6 billion and $37.4 billion, a smaller reduction than the cut to $26.5 billion in its earlier plan.

That might not be enough relief for Puerto Rico as the island struggles to grow its economy and improve its finances, said Matt Dalton, chief executive officer of Rye Brook, New York-based Belle Haven Investments, which oversees $4.2 billion of municipal bonds, including commonwealth securities.

“Nothing’s changed and without a drastic reduction of the debt service that Puerto Rico is under, I don’t know how they’re going to climb out of their hole,” Dalton said. “I still worry there’s still a long road ahead even if they did come to some agreement.”

Puerto Rico and its agencies racked up $70 billion of debt after borrowing for years to pay its bills. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla in June 2105 said the island was unable to repay all of its obligations on time and in full.

Two agencies have missed debt payments since then and its Government Development Bank owes $422 million May 1. The commonwealth and its agencies face a $2 billion debt payment July 1.

The revised plan increases to $1.85 billion from $1.7 billion the amount Puerto Rico will spend on annual debt-service.

Puerto Rico’s revised proposal offers a 74 percent recovery on general obligations and commonwealth-backed debt, up from 72 percent in its first plan that it unveiled Feb. 1. Sales-tax bonds, called Cofinas by their Spanish acronym, would recover 57 percent, up from 49 percent.

It also replaces “growth bonds” included in the commonwealth’s first proposal, with capital-appreciation bonds, which delay interest payments until the debt mature. Growth bonds, by comparison, would only repay if Puerto Rico’s revenue exceeds certain projections.

The commonwealth would allocate $2.4 billion to its pensions in the first five years of the plan. Puerto Rico’s largest pension system’s assets were less than one percent of the $30.2 billion it owes current and future retirees, as of June 2014.

“A sustainable solution cannot place the burden on one stakeholder group alone, and we have the moral and legal obligation to protect the health, safety and well-being of our citizens,” Victor Suarez, Puerto Rico’s secretary of state, said in a statement. “These are the priorities we must balance while working to reach an agreement that will put Puerto Rico back on the path to prosperity.”

Puerto Rico residents who hold commonwealth securities would be repaid last.

The revised proposal offers those on-island investors a return of full principal beginning in 2065 and ending 2069. They would receive a reduced 2 percent interest rate starting in 2017.

158,"U.S. health officials recommended cutting the amount of salt added to foods to help Americans reduce their sodium consumption by about a third, according to proposed guidelines that are likely to have a wide-ranging impact on the processed food industry in the United States.

Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease and stroke – two major causes of death in the United States.

The average sodium intake in the United States is about 3,400 mg per day. The guidelines set targets for the food industry to help reduce sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.

The health agency said the voluntary guidelines would apply to major food manufacturers and restaurants.

About half of every food dollar goes to food consumed outside the home, according to the USDA’s Economic Research Service.

Many U.S. food companies, including Campbell Soup cpb , General Mills gis , and Kraft Heinz krft have already cut salt levels to some extent in anticipation of the guidelines, which have been in the works since 2011.

On Thursday, Starbucks sbux announced that Fremar will lead the creative development of all Starbucks global brand initiatives and marketing campaigns, including digital marketing, packaging, and oversight of the brand, as well as marketing for the Roastery concept stores and the rare, small-batch Reserve coffees. She will also lead a team of more than 100 people who work at the company’s creative studio in Seattle.

Fremar will start her new job in October, beginning with a three-week training window that includes work as a store barista and a “coffee immersion spanning the globe,” Starbucks added.

Most recently, Fremar served as creative director for Under Armour’s ua women’s and concept divisions. She also has held senior positions at Gucci Group and Ralph Lauren, rl and began her career in New York City at The Museum of Modern Art.

The appointment comes a few days after Starbucks reorganized some of the company’s senior leadership roles, pivoting to focus more on long-term strategy and innovation after an emphasis on digital technology. Starbucks has made impressive progress on the digital side, steadily adding new loyalty program users and convincing a growing number of people to use their mobile devices to make purchases and place orders for pickup.

There were signs earlier this month that a pivot might be in order. Last week, Starbucks reported that its impressive winning streak—25 straight quarters of comparable-store sales growth of 5% or greater in the U.S.—had come to end, as a change to the coffee giant’s rewards program hurt a popular Frappuccino promotion. That led to some worries about the company’s growth in the important U.S. market, though executives promised the disappointing growth was an “anomaly.”",Leanne Fremar officially starts in October.,"Generated Summary: Starbucks has named former Under Armour executive Leanne Fremar to the coffee giant’s creative director role, where she will oversee some of the company’s more premium offerings."

But after describing its big investments in e-commerce and plans to build more small-format Neighborhood Market grocery stores, Wal-Mart had some of bad news: the company lowered its sales forecast for the rest of the fiscal year. The company now expects global sales to rise by just 2-3% rather than its earlier forecast of 3-5% growth.

The trimmed outlook unnerved investors, especially because the all-important holiday season is just around the corner. The retailer blamed a tougher-than-expected sales environment and cuts to a U.S. food stamp program.

And Wal-Mart WMT does not expect especially robust growth through 2018. Sales will rise 2.5-3.5% annually through 2018, the company said, while profits will rise more slowly because of increased investment on e-commerce.

“We have many customers that do rely on SNAP (food stamp program), so it did affect our sales,” Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said in a conference call. “There’s been a general weakness in the economy.”

Last November, the government cut food-stamp benefits for about 47 million Americans. About 18% of all food stamp dollars in the U.S. are spent at Walmart.

The company is unlikely to find relief abroad, the source of 40% of overall revenue. Fluctuating exchange rates means that sales abroad are being translated into a smaller amount of U.S. dollars.

“Everywhere I travel, I see tough economies and stretched consumers, and that hasn’t changed through the course of the year,” Wal-Mart International Chief Executive David Cheesewright told investors earlier in the day.

Wal-Mart’s lowered forecast wasn’t the only thing that might give investors pause after last week’s bullish holiday spending forecast by the National Retail Federation, which predicted that U.S. holiday spending will rise 4.1%.

165,"The Turnbull government will need to show supreme budget heroics next week to explain why the deficit has increased by billions of dollars in the past five months, Deloitte Access Economics says.

The economic consultancy firm has released its respected Budget Monitor, outlining the pressures on federal government finances before Malcolm Turnbull’s government brings down its first budget on 3 May.

It warned the electorate was at risk of “sleepwalking through another election campaign” in which no major party faces up to the fact that spending growth is far outpacing revenue growth, unless the government used the budget to be honest with voters.

Related: No changes to negative gearing or capital gains tax in budget says Malcolm Turnbull

Commonwealth deficits to 2018-19 were likely to be $21bn worse than official forecasts just five months ago, it said.

It called on the Treasury and the finance department to use the budget to promote believable forecasts about the rate of economic growth, and the price of key commodities such as iron ore and coal, so voters had a better understanding of the real costs of the services they wanted.

“Major miners, who account for a sixth of company tax in an average year, have taken huge profit hits,” the Budget Monitor said. “Overall profit taxes are forecast to fall $4.7bn shy of the latest official estimates for 2015-16.

“[And] special mention needs to go to resource rent taxes, which continue to head the way of the dodo. Low oil and gas prices seem to be lingering longer than a great aunt at Christmas, with commensurate carnage in collections.

“And spare a thought for superannuation taxes, which are suffering from further downward revisions after a horror run in recent times.”

The report said the budget boom of the past decade had turned into a budget bust, with the combination of China’s slowdown, low commodity prices and weak wage growth cutting overall revenue by $4.1bn in 2015-16, with a further shortfall of $3.5bn in 2016-17.

It projected a Commonwealth deficit of $41.7bn in 2015-16, saying this was “a substantial $4.3bn worse than projected” in the mid-year budget update in December.

“Back in 2013 we didn’t get a Pre-Election Fiscal Outlook. What got served up to the public was more of a Pixies, Elves and Fairies outlook,” the report’s authors said.

“2016 is an election year. That’s a big reason to hope the 2016 [budget] won’t be like the last Pre-Election and Fiscal Outlook. The 2013 PEFO essentially assured voters that within a decade, whoever they voted in would deliver over $80 billion a year in as yet unidentified savings on spending and that much of the revenue shortfall of earlier years was locked in.

“Err, that’d be ‘no’ and ‘no’ respectively.”

The Deloitte Access report made a dramatic downward revision to official GDP forecasts, saying GDP growth was likely to fall from 2.8% in 2015-16 to just 2% in 2016-17.

It forecast an increase to 2.8% and 2.7% in 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively.

Bureau of Statistics figures show annual economic growth is currently 3%.

Deloitte director Chris Richardson said Treasury and Finance could choose to “play safe” in this budget by failing to make its revenue and spending forecasts more realistic.

A study of intergenerational mobility conducted by Italian economists Guglielmo Barone and Sauro Mocetti and published by the U.K.-based Centre for Economic Policy Research looked at the family names of the wealthiest people in Florence going back to the year 1427. (For context, that was just 10 years after the Battle of Agincourt, a few years before Joan of Arc was burned at the stake, and around the time the Medici family rose to power.)

Comparing tax records in 1427 to records from 2011, researchers discovered that “the top earners among the current taxpayers were found to have already been at the top of the socioeconomic ladder six centuries ago.” All the more remarkable, the authors point out, when you consider the political, economic, and social upheavals that have rocked the country during that long period of time.

It is well established that economic advantages—and disadvantages—are passed from one generation to the next, but this study points to much longer lasting effects of income inequality on economic mobility. Nor is it the first report to use old records to measure economic mobility—a U.K. study recently found that family status in England remained largely unchanged from 1170 to 2012, more than 800 years later, reports Quartz.

On the upside, the study authors note that, while the evidence points to substantial economic immobility on the whole, mobility in 2011 was much improved from 1427, when Florence was a “quasi-immobile society.”","More evidence that the rich get richer, even over hundreds and hundreds of years.","Generated Summary: It’s no surprise that having wealthy parents means a person is more likely to be wealthy themselves, but according new research the effect holds true for far longer than is commonly believed.

170,"Online searches and applications for U.S. citizenship have been higher in past few months than at any time during the 2012 presidential election cycle, according to data from Google and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The latest federal data on citizenship applications shows that more immigrants are trying to become U.S. citizens in recent months, but it may be hard to link those applications to the rise of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to immigration experts.

Applications for immigrants applying to be U.S. citizens are higher now than they were in the last election cycle. Between October 2015 and March 2016, Immigration Services received 439,887 N-400 applications for citizenship, compared to 412,414 applications in 2012 during the same period. That’s about a 6% increase.

Search results from Google reviewed exclusively by TIME reveal that search interest in citizenship peaked on January 10 and has remained high since, indicating that immigrants are looking for more information about naturalization. Many of those searching Google are likely Latino: Of the top eight questions asked in searches, seven are in Spanish.

Immigration experts say it’s hard to say whether the increase in applications is related to Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric.

“I’m not sure that you can say all people naturalizing are voting against Trump,” Clarissa Martinez de Castro, who heads mobilization efforts for Hispanic advocacy group the National Council for La Raza, told TIME. “There is anecdotal evidence that Trump is one factor, but I wouldn’t say that is the only factor.”

The biggest reason for the surge, according to Martinez de Castro, is that it’s an election year, which typically sees high numbers of citizenship applications. More than one million people were naturalized during 2008, according to federal immigration data.

Immigration groups had been gearing up to help people affected by President Obama’s executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants to delay deportation, but with that program under hold due to an ongoing lawsuit, they’ve switched those resources to citizenship efforts.

“There was an infrastructure in place that could help people navigate the naturalization process,” Martinez de Castro said. “The process itself, like filling out the application, can be quite intimidating—it’s a long application, there’s a lot of questions in it, you may not be completely sure what they mean.”

The naturalization process takes about six months, so those wanting to become a U.S. citizen to vote would have had to apply by about March or April—at the latest—in order to have a chance to register before the general election. And immigrants applying to become naturalized U.S. citizens would have had to have held permanent resident status for five years—or more, as Martinez de Castro says many do.

“Citizenship assistance has been going on and will continue to go on,” Martinez de Castro told TIME. “I just don’t want people to get an impression that the citizenship effort sprung up out of nothing because of what’s going on right now. I think people saw increased demand in some places, but citizenship applications are continuous.”",But it's not clear how much is related to Donald Trump.,"Generated Summary: Online searches and applications for U.S. citizenship have been higher in past few months than at any time during the 2012 presidential election cycle, according to data from Google and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services."
171,"Mary Louise Coulouris, who has died aged 72 after suffering from motor neurone disease, was a prolific printmaker, painter and muralist whose vibrant images were exhibited widely. The richness of her palette derived from her love of Greece, where her family's roots lay.

Her father was the actor George Coulouris, who was born in Manchester to a Greek father and an English mother. Mary Louise was born, like her older brother, in New York. With his American wife, Louise, George had made his way to Broadway and into minor American movies before appearing in Orson Welles's Citizen Kane in 1941.

Hollywood brought the good life, away from wartime austerity. Mary Louise was introduced to George's starry friends, enjoyed visits to film studios and began painting. However, in the era of Senator Joseph McCarthy's blacklisting of suspected communists, in 1950 he chose to return to the UK.

Following St Paul's girls' school and Parliament Hill school in London, Coulouris attended Chelsea School of Art for two years. She then completed a three-year diploma at the Slade School of Fine Art (1958-61) under William Coldstream, learning etching from Anthony Gross, followed by a year's postgraduate course. After winning a French government scholarship, she spent two years in Paris, at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and at Atelier 17 under the master printmaker Stanley William Hayter.

While she established herself as an artist, she taught part-time for eight years at London colleges; at Wolverhampton; and later for the Open College of the Arts, and classes in Scotland and Greece.

In 1971 Coulouris married a Glaswegian civil engineer, Gordon Wallace, whom she met while sketching by the Regent's canal in north London. In 1976 they settled in Linlithgow, West Lothian, where she established her studio. By then, as well as group show appearances, she had had four solo exhibitions, the first in Paris in 1964, another at the Ferens art gallery, Hull, in 1967 and two at the Boadicea gallery, London, in 1970 and 1972.

More than 20 were to follow. It was logical that Greece would attract her – she had several Greek government scholarships – and her last four exhibitions were there. After Gordon retired, their house on the Greek island of Hydra became a second home. Greece enriched her palette and widened her subjects.

From the 1980s, Coulouris produced a huge body of work, interspersed with a range of prizes, scholarships and residencies. Public art included murals for Linlithgow railway station in 1985 and Royal Edinburgh hospital, 1990; designs for rugs for the new Scottish Poetry Library, Edinburgh, 1999; tapestry for Yale College, Wrexham, 2002; and watercolours for the House of Lords, 2004. The Graphothek Berlin; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris; and the New York Public Library were among numerous public, corporate and private collections that have acquired her work.

Coulouris wrote that her paintings were inextricably linked to a living European humanist tradition. Drawing and colour were key elements. ""I am not very enthusiastic about postmodernist ideas which reject painting as well as modernism. I suppose I am a post-postmodernist.""

She is survived by her husband, a son, Duncan, and a daughter, Saro.

173,"FORTUNE — BlackRock Inc. chief executive Larry Fink said during a speech Tuesday that longer life spans and underfunded retirement plans are the defining challenge of our age, and went so far as to recommend that the U.S. consider making retirement savings mandatory.

Fink acknowledged that retirement under-funding is not a new issue, but times have changed and the problem has become more pressing. “We’re at a point now where the interest rate cycle makes it very difficult [for investors to save],” he said, during remarks delivered to a group of NYU Stern business school students. “If you can no longer buy a 30-year bond with a 7% yield, how will investors achieve the necessary savings outcome?”

“The current system is not working, and we need a comprehensive approach that includes some form of mandatory savings in addition to Social Security,” the 60-year-old Fink added.

While the BlackRock BLK chief often speaks on retirement issues, he has never before suggested mandatory savings (perhaps something similar to what has already been enacted in Chile and Australia).

Fink explained that only two-thirds of Americans have saved for retirement and most have saved less than $25,000. The average retiree depends on Social Security for 70% of his or her income, he said, citing statistics from the Employee Benefit Research Institute.

“Social Security has become far more essential to retirement than intended when the program was conceived,” Fink said. “When Social Security was launched, a 21-year-old male had a fifty-fifty chance of living to the age of 65.”

Fink, who sits on the finance committee at NYU, described his speech as a call to action, particularly because politicians and business leaders ignore the retirement savings crisis. “This is a big public policy issue that we need to address, that corporations need to address, and that local governments need to address,” he said. “We need a debate. We need to undertake a comprehensive review of retirement policy in America.”

Fink and BlackRock approached the business school about a talk on the issue of retirement, a BlackRock spokesman said. Students were the right audience because they have time to do something about the crisis, and they have the energy and interest required to tackle big problems.

Fink noted that the entire financial sector is “wired for short-term incentives,” which is exacerbated by the fact that we live in a “world of 9,000 tweets a second,” and that this mentality makes it hard to think about long-term objectives. He said that investors should look beyond the short-term noise and keep money working in the markets for longer investment horizons.

He added that the shift from pensions to 401(k) plans does not absolve employers of their “moral obligation” to help employees save for retirement, saying that workplaces should provide education about retirement investing, matching funds, and auto-enrollment into 401(k) plans.

His most interesting critiques were reserved for the asset management industry, telling reporters after the lecture that “most financial institutions failed society” in the run-up to the recent financial crisis. During his remarks he said that companies like BlackRock should stop measuring products against benchmarks and start judging whether they meet investor liabilities and needs.

175,"Live lobster prices are high in New England and beyond as fishermen eagerly await the summer arrival of the region’s beloved crustaceans, which could come slightly early and send prices down.

Lobstermen in Maine and Massachusetts, who supply the U.S. with most of its domestic lobsters, are coming off several years of high catches for lobsters, a signature food item for the region.

Prices for lobsters also have been somewhat high for most of the last two years, with the consumer price currently in the range of $8 to $12 per pound at most retail outlets in Maine, the country’s biggest lobster producer. That’s a couple dollars more than a year ago.

Prices vary around the country, but the arrival of New England’s lobsters will likely lower prices nationwide. Prices tend to fall every year in the summer when many lobsters reach legal trapping size and catches increase.

Scientists have warned the bigger catches can come early this year — a circumstance that can disrupt the lobster supply chain and depress prices.

So far, that hasn’t happened. Right now, lobsters are trickling in, said David Cousens, a South Thomaston lobsterman and the president of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association.

‘‘As long as they keep coming slow, there’s going to be a big demand for them,’’ he said.

The busiest portion of Maine’s summer lobster fishing season typically begins around early July, coinciding with the tourist season. Scientists with the Portland-based Gulf of Maine Research Institute have predicted this year’s lobster season will start two or three weeks early because of warm ocean temperatures.

Andy Pershing, a scientist with the institute, said temperatures in the central Gulf of Maine are running about one degree Fahrenheit higher than the 14-year average. He said the bump in lobster catches could happen any day now.

A very early lobster season happened in 2012, and prices fell to their lowest point in almost 20 years. Steve Kingston, who runs a restaurant and lobster pound in Kennebunk, said that hasn’t been the case this year. Kingston, who buys lobsters direct from fishermen, said some have been held back from fishing by high winds and a surprisingly cold spring.

‘‘There certainly isn’t enough of them to start moving price down,’’ Kingston said.

Lobstermen have experienced unprecedented production in recent years. The nation’s lobster catch was worth more than a half-billion dollars last year, by far the most in history.

Lobster dealers are approaching this season as they would any other, said Annie Tselikis, executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers’ Association.

‘‘If weather or volume or any other variable changes based on your best estimate of what may happen, you adjust your plans and act accordingly,’’ she said.","If lobster season arrives earlier than usual, it could disrupt the supply chain and drive down prices across the region.","Generated Summary: Live lobster prices are high in New England and beyond as fishermen eagerly await the summer arrival of the region's beloved crustaceans, which could come slightly early and send prices down."
176,"Australia's medicinal cannabis industry officially gets the green light next week but the woman instrumental in driving the changes warns it'll be a long time before patients see the benefits.

From November 1, cannabis for therapeutic use will become a controlled drug rather than a prohibited one.

People will also be able to apply for licences to grow and manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia.

But Lucy Haslam, who became the face of the campaign for change after medicinal cannabis helped her late son Dan with the severe nausea caused by chemotherapy, says patients still face many hurdles to access.

""I've got a lot of calls from patients saying how do I get it,"" Ms Haslam told AAP.

""The reality is there's nothing to get yet.""

Elaine Darby, chief executive of medicinal cannabis company AusCann, says patients should be able to start accessing Australian-grown cannabis from late 2017.

It's now up to other states and territories to enact their own legislation to enable access, as NSW and Queensland have done.

But Ms Haslam says access from late 2017 is the best-case scenario.

Once licences are granted, growers will need to import stock to get started, grow and manufacture the product, and then get it approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.

Until that happens, the only way to access medicinal cannabis is through the existing TGA special access scheme, which is complicated and ""very problematic"".

There's also the issue of educating doctors who will need to prescribe the cannabis as they have been reluctant to get on board.

""There's still quite a process that's going to take time - I think everyone is kind of making it up as they go along,"" Ms Haslam says.

""It's very frustrating for patients that are wanting to access it now.""

Ms Haslam says Tuesday's changes are a significant milestone and eventually, Australia will have one of the world's best systems because it's been approved federally.

But until it's up and running, she's pushing for a national compassionate access scheme for patients who need medicinal cannabis right now.

Ms Haslam is calling for legislation to ensure patients needing to access the black market for now are protected, instead of relying on police discretion.

""At the moment people clearly don't have a choice, people are still effectively breaking the law, and that's a really big burden if you're very sick.""

NSW already has a compassionate access system but it's deeply flawed because it's only available to adults and the terminally ill, Ms Haslam says.

Patients, researchers and entrepreneurs are set to meet in Sydney on Saturday to brainstorm ideas on how to overcome the hurdles patients are likely to face in accessing medicinal cannabis.

The organiser of the Seedlings event, entrepreneur Adam Miller who founded medicinal cannabis incubation program BuddingTech, says despite the many unknowns and barriers, there'll be plenty of opportunity.

The Australian medicinal cannabis market is set to be worth around $150 million with massive growth predicted.

Michael Gunner is leading a 10-day trade mission to Japan, Korea and China in his first international trip as Territory leader.

He met with Inpex chief executive Toshiaki Kitamura to sign two agreements that will support future jobs and economic growth in the Territory as the construction phase winds down.

It reaffirmed the company's commitment to provide local employment during the 40-year project.

Mr Gunner also signed a lease agreement which provides the option for development of the land surrounding the project and expansion of operations for 15 years.

The NT is home to the Inpex Ichthys project, the single largest Japanese investment in Australia and also the largest Japanese investment outside of Japan.

More than 8,000 people are working at Darwin's Bladin Point during this final period of construction and there are concerns for NT jobs once it finishes up.

Mr Gunner said the project will contribute to the Territory economy for decades.

""The Ichthys LNG Project has at least a 40-year life and today's agreement means there will be ongoing opportunities for Territory businesses during the plant's operations,"" Mr Gunner said.

""During the construction phase, more than 1,000 Territory businesses have secured work on the project.""

Opposition Leader Gary Higgins criticised the Labor government's lack of a jobs target or pathway to a major project to replace Inpex.

Officials in Colorado, whose exchange was built in part by hCentive, are currently trying to figure out how that martkeplace will sustain itself financially after federal funding runs out.

In the state house of Rhode Island, whose own exchange is faced with a similar problem, there is ""a bipartisan bill to push their exchange to the federal exchange,"" Archambault said. He added, it could take several years for all of the states who end up moving to HealthCare.gov to decide to make that move.

Dan Mendelson, the CEO of the Avalere Health consultancy, said those coming years might offer even more incentive for some states to drop their exchanges and move to the federal marketplace.

Over that time, Mendelson said, the federal government will ""update their own systems"" on HealthCare.gov to accommodate rule changes or to accomplish technological efficiencies. ""The states will have to do that"" on their own exchanges as well, he said.

By turning over enrollment functions to HealthCare.gov, Mendelson said, those states will be off the hook for those system tweaks.

If more than a handful of states end up chucking their own exchanges in favor of the federal exchange, it would further underscore the dramatic turnaround at HealthCare.gov. In its first two months of operation last fall, the federal site's technological troubles delayed enrollment for thousands.

Pacquiao, a high school dropout from a poverty-stricken rural family who went on to become a boxing legend, made the remark when he and other Philippine senatorial candidates were asked by the local TV5 network about their views on same-sex marriage.

His remarks were posted online Monday by TV5, sparking criticism, including by some fellow Filipino celebrities.

""It's just common sense,"" said the 37-year-old Pacquiao, who is currently a member of the House of Representatives. ""Have you seen any animal having male-to-male or female-to-female relations?""

Animals, he said, are better because they recognize gender differences, and ""if you have male-to-male or female-to-female (relationships), then people are worse than animals.""

Among those who strongly reacted to his remarks was popular gay comedian and TV host Jose Marie Viceral, known as Vice Ganda. Viceral tweeted Tuesday that lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders are humans, not animals. He said that they're not saints, but that they'll pray for Pacquiao.

Vice Ganda posted a picture of Pope Francis, suggesting that even the beloved leader of the Roman Catholic does not condemn gays. He quoted the pope: ""If a person is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?""

Danton Remoto of the LGBT group Ladlad said Pacquiao's comments showed he had a shallow understanding of issues important to the LGBT community.

""He is running for a national position and he should be a senator of everybody, not just over the hill boxers and straight people,"" Remoto said in a telephone interview.

Pacquiao, who has become an active Christian, said in an Instagram posting that he was not condemning anyone, but was just expounding on the truth professed by the Bible.

I'd ""rather obey the Lord's command than obeying the desires of the flesh,"" he said.

He posted a biblical phrase that says: ""Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men.""

181,"President Barack Obama criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that activists should be willing to sit down and discuss their agenda with leaders in power rather than “yelling at them.”

At a youth town hall in London on Saturday, the president lauded the movement for effectively bringing attention to racially motivated police violence across the country, but he said the harsh tone activists are using is troubling.

“You can’t just keep on yelling at them and you can’t refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,” Obama said. “The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room and then start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable —that can institutionalize the changes you seek and to engage the other side.”

RELATED: The complex history of the controversial 1994 crime bill

Obama’s remarks come weeks after activists from the movement protested at presidential candidates’ campaign events, including Hillary Clinton —the Democratic Party’s front-runner.

In Philadelphia earlier this month, when former President Bill Clinton was campaigning for his wife, Hillary, he engaged in a heated back and forth exchange with activists who slammed him for the 1994 crime bill he enacted.

The Clintons have faced intense scrutiny from Black Lives Matter activists and other protesters over the law, which they say unfairly put a high number of black and Latino Americans in prisons and allocated billions of dollars for prison grants and police expansion.

And at a South Carolina private fundraiser in February, an activist from the group interrupted the event, calling out Clinton for the “super predators” term she had used to advocate for the 1994 measure as first Lady. Some say the racially-charged term targets young people of color. Clinton had recently said he regrets using the term.

At the London youth forum, president Obama called on activists to compromise with those they disagree with.

“Too often what I see is wonderful activism that highlights a problem, but then people feel so passionately and are invested in the purity of their position that they never take that next step and say, ‘well now I have to sit down and try to actually get something done ?’” he said.","""You can't just keep on yelling at [political leaders] and you can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,"" Obama said.","Generated Summary: President Barack Obama criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that activists should be willing to sit down and discuss their agenda with leaders in power rather than “yelling at them.”"

The annual festival, beloved for its eclectic programs and $15 tickets, runs from Sept. 26 through Oct. 8 and features 20 works, many of them New York premieres.

Mr. McGregor’s currently untitled work, which was commissioned for this Fall for Dance, is a pas de deux created for the American Ballet Theater principal dancer Herman Cornejo and Alessandra Ferri, who retired from the company in 2007. The two have performed together before — recently in Ms. Ferri’s warmly received return to Ballet Theater for a performance of Kenneth MacMillan’s “Romeo and Juliet.”

Other premieres include Ms. Streb’s “Airslice,” also created for the festival, and Dada Masilo’s “Spring,” inspired by Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring.” Previously, Ms. Masila has turned classics on their head in postmodern adaptations that include African dance idioms, as in her “Swan Lake,” which was performed at the Joyce Theater in February.

The retired New York City Ballet dancer Wendy Whelan and the Royal Ballet principal dancer Edward Watson, whose program “Whelan/Watson: Other Stories” at City Center was postponed last year with no rescheduled date, will perform “The Ballad of Mack and Ginny,” choreographed by Arthur Pita and inspired by Brecht and Weill’s “The Threepenny Opera.”

Dance companies in the lineup include Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, performing the Judith Jamison classic “Cry”; Ballet Theater, presenting Frederick Ashton’s sublime “Monotones II,” set to Satie; and the Sarasota Ballet, which will also feature Ashton — his “Marguerite and Armand,” originally choreographed for Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev and inspired by the Alexandre Dumas fils novel “La Dame aux Camélias.”

183,"Drivers are getting a better deal at the bowser, the competition regulator's latest report on petrol prices reveals, but the NSW motorists' lobby has warned of possible price gouging these holidays.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Monday that petrol prices in the five biggest cities - Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth - fell by 3.8 cents to 114.2 cents per litre in the 2016 September quarter.

The drop put prices below both the previous quarter and the annual average for 2015-16.

""A drop in refiner margins in the last quarter has helped to push prices down locally,"" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said.

""Australian motorists have benefited as prices have fallen, which will be especially welcome as we move into the busy holiday period.""

The NRMA said the figures were encouraging but urged retailers to do the right thing by consumers as the holidays drew closer.

""We're always concerned about price gouging at Christmas time and this Christmas will be no different,"" spokesman Peter Khoury told reporters in Sydney on Monday.

""There is certainly nothing when you look at the key factors to suggest prices should go up beyond the regular cycle.""

The ACCC found that Brisbane's average retail price of 115.2 cents per litre was the highest out of the largest five cities.

It also found that drivers in NSW, which has mandated that ethanol make up six per cent of the fuel that service stations sell, forked out for premium unleaded petrol at a far higher rate than their interstate counterparts.

Premium accounted for 54 per cent of total petrol sales in Sydney in 2014-15, compared with 23 per cent of sales in other states.

The ACCC said the ethanol mandate may have pushed Sydneysiders to spend an extra $85 million in that financial year.

But Mr Khoury said there was no need for most drivers to pay more for premium.

""The reality is, about 75 per cent of the fleet in NSW can run on E10,"" he said.

""Unless you're driving a high-performance vehicle or something built before 1986, you don't need to use premium and you don't need to be paying all that extra money.

The U.S. Federal Reserve says historically low inflation is transitory. The market begs to differ.

Inflation has fallen short of the Fed’s 2% target for more than three years. And while the central bank is all but set to raise interest rates next week, the inflation conundrum should give the Fed pause as it weighs the pace of rate increases in 2016 and perhaps beyond.

Friday’s report on producer prices and Tuesday’s consumer-price index, out before the Fed’s monetary-policy announcement Wednesday, bear watching. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast producer prices in November were flat from a month ago. They have suffered 10 straight year-over-year declines.

Falling oil prices, a strengthening dollar and weak overseas demand all have contributed to low inflation. Most of those factors should stabilize in the coming months, even if they fail to retrace some of their recent path.

That plays a role in expectations for rates to rise by a full percentage point by this time next year and another full point the following year, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

But those liftoff projections have been wrong before and consumer sentiment suggests caution. Surveys of inflation expectations from the University of Michigan, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are all at or near record lows.

Investors feel the same way. Consider the so-called 10-year break-even rate, which measures the yield spread between the benchmark Treasury note and 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities. It currently reflects investor expectations of 1.56% annualized inflation on average over the next decade. The figure has remained below the Fed’s 2% inflation goal since September 2014.

True, the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator—the personal consumption expenditures price index less food and energy—may look somewhat different. Today, though, its year-over-year rise is well short of its target at just 1.3%.

Robust jobs growth and budding signs of rising wages could light a fire under inflation in the coming months. That is what the Fed is hoping for. But until consumer and investor inflation expectations change, rate expectations should be similarly subdued.

The high-impact collision in February resulted in two lawsuits being brought against Jenner, who was yet to publically transition from Bruce to her identify as a woman at the time of the crash.

Footage taken from a passing public bus’s two cameras shows the former Olympian colliding into the back of a white Lexus, driven by 69-year-old Kim Howe, who was later pronounced dead at the scene.

Her vehicle sharply veers into oncoming traffic before crashing head-on with a Hummer.

A distracted Jenner, seen towing a large trailer, fails to stop ploughing into the back of another car, this time a black Prius.

Jenner avoided criminal charges over the incident with a law enforcement source claiming in April that she was driving under the limit at 60k/h.

In a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the 65-year-old millionaire in May, Howe's two adult stepchildren accused Jenner of being ""careless, reckless and negligent"" while having ""violated the rules of the road.""

Last month the driver of the Prius, 29-year-old Jessica Steindorff, also filed a lawsuit against Jenner for property damage and personal injury.

In April, Jenner publically outed herself as transgender in an interview with Diane Sawyer, which drew nearly 17 million viewers.

SunEdison, the Missouri solar energy company that purchased the Boston wind developer First Wind last year, said Wednesday that it has completed financing and started construction on a 185-megawatt wind farm near the town of Bingham. The wind farm was previously under development by First Wind.

The company expects to spend $420 million on the 56-turbine project, and has taken out $360 million in loans to build the wind farm. Eversource, National Grid, and Unitil will buy the power generated by the turbines according to the terms of 15-year agreements the companies negotiated, according to David Fowler, SunEdison’s director of development for New England.

“We anticipate on having commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2016,” Fowler said. He said the company is already clearing land and building roads, but bad weather may affect the pace of construction, especially when the frozen land begins to thaw in the spring.

Fowler, who worked for First Wind before it was acquired, said the Bingham wind farm has been under development for five years. Upon completion, he said, it could connect to the New England electrical grid with only small modifications that SunEdison will finance.

Many other proposed wind projects in Maine will require larger transmission projects, paid for by utility companies from southern New England under a massive bid solicitation that could finance enough renewable energy infrastructure to power 136,000 Massachusetts homes.

The Bingham project will grow SunEdison’s wind energy generating capacity in Maine by 50 percent and employ 400 construction workers, according to the company. The wind farm had faced local opposition, but it was approved by the state late last year, according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.","SunEdison, the solar company that purchased Boston’s First Wind last year, has begun construction on a Maine wind farm it says will power 65,000 homes.","Generated Summary: A renewable energy developer has broken ground on a giant wind farm in central Maine that is expected to power 65,000 homes."

Over the past week, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's administration has lashed out at the central bank, urging it to aggressively lower interest rates to shore up economic growth ahead of general elections in June. The political pressure has troubled investors, sending the lira to an all-time low of 2.6290 per dollar on Thursday, the third straight day of record declines.

Erdogan's demands come after the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) lowered benchmark rates last month, its second cut since December. While the CBRT has been under pressure to ease policy for years, markets are worried recent scathing attacks could spell the end of the central bank's independence.

190,"Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase jpm have lost nearly $8.7 billion in value in the last two days, after CEO Jamie Dimon announced plans to increase energy loan reserves by 60% to $1.3 billion.

Dimon told investors Tuesday that the bank had added roughly $500 million to its reserves for energy sector loan losses in the first quarter of 2016. Although that brings J.P. Morgan’s reserves up to just below 3% of the bank’s exposure to the sector, the news shook investor confidence.

Shares fell 4.2%, to $56.11 Tuesday. The stock continued its slide Wednesday, falling 1.43% and whittling down Morgan’s market cap to $203.1 billion.

During Tuesday’s summit, Dimon also projected that J.P. Morgan’s losses from loans made out to the energy sector could equal as much as $2.8 billion. The bank’s total exposure to oil and gas is roughly $44 billion. About $19 billion of its energy loans were given to companies now rated as junk.

The news comes in a year when the financial sector has grown increasingly shaky, wondering how the downturn in oil prices will affect banks that have loaned heavily to the energy sector.

Fellow banking titan Goldman Sachs gs disclosed in a regulatory filing on Monday that 40% of its loans were made out to oil and gas companies that had been relegated to junk.

It also should be noted that investor sentiment regarding oil was low yesterday after Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi ruled out the possibility of oil production cuts, sending prices below $33 per barrel Wednesday.

For Dimon, the price of oil and losses from loans in the energy sector could have an adverse effect on his paycheck this year. The CEO has the chance to earn over $10 million in his 2015 performance bonus, according to Bloomberg —if he can lead J.P. Morgan to outperform five of its peers.

What’s different about Twitter’s feature is that it will also be able to suggest other pictures for you to alter to encourage users to “participate in trending conversations and breaking news” and even show you “how other users from around the world have edited the same photo.”

“We’re always researching potential new ways to make Twitter more expressive,” a spokesperson told Re/code. The feature is currently being tested by a handful of Twitter users.

It’s uncertain whether the product will actually make it onto the official website and, if it does, it may be called something different. “Stickers” isn’t the official name, it’s just one of various options. Others include “Taptags,” “#stamps,” and “Remix.”

Facebook has drawn heat from feminists for considering images of topless women as violations of their policies against nudity and obscenity —even when the photographs depict breastfeeding mothers.

Feminist writer Soraya Chemaly brought attention to the policy change on The Huffington Post, noting that the social media company had quietly changed its policy on obscene content in regard to breastfeeding mothers. Images that include the exposed nipples of breastfeeding can now be posted on the site without the risk of removal.

“The female nipple ban no longer exists for breastfeeding mothers, which should make many people who have been pushing the company to address a nudity double standard at least partially happy,” Chemaly wrote on Monday.

The ban drew the attention of women last year who took the site to task over the policy, which they said is an example of gender-based discrimination. A campaign led by Chemaly called on Facebook to combat both hate-speech and “obscenity” double standards. It garnered over 60,000 tweets, 5000 emails, and a bundle of disgruntled advertisers, and led Facebook to respond with an explanation of its policy.

The startup, which focuses on product discovery through barcode scanning, is releasing an update to its iPhone app that lets kids create mobile wish lists they can send straight to the big guy at the North Pole.

The feel-good Holiday Wish List update includes themed fare and encourages kids to create a wish list or two by scanning product barcodes in stores or browsing products via the app. Once the list is complete, children can ship the list — complete with product photos — off to “Santa.” Barcode Hero will deliver a copy via e-mail to parents or guardians who can also share it with their helper “elves.”

The wish list addition is cleverly designed with children in mind. Kids can personalize their lists with a digital letter, tell Santa whether they’ve been naughty or nice, and capture and attach a photo to show just how deserving (and adorably cute) they are this year.

“Instead of sitting down in the living room with the children to write a letter to Santa on pencil and paper, Barcode Hero allows parents to make wish lists a modern, family-focused holiday activity, complete with photos,” says co-founder Blake Scholl. “We’re sure Santa will appreciate the help!”

The Holiday Wish List update might be more fun than function, but it’s the kind of thing that gives you the warm-and-fuzzies this time of year.

Speaking on panel about mobile payments during Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen, Colorado, some of the players in that market denounced near field communication — the technology that some have heralded as the driver of the cashless revolution. EBay EBAY , which owns PayPal, has already famously shunned the technology, which allows mobile phones to make transactions by tapping on them. (At a Fortune event earlier this year, CEO John Donahoe said NFC stands for “not for commerce.”)

While panelists acknowledged the role that the buzzy technology would have, none thought it would be a cornerstone for the market. “It’s part of the solution,” said Ron Hirson, co-founder and president of Boku, a payment company that deals directly with carriers. “It’s not a global standard for payments.” Dawn Lepore, a former eBay employee and now CEO of Internet loan service Prosper, says the market will be much more segmented. “I don’t think it’s winner take all,” she said. “There will be multiple successes.”

Still, faith in NFC has gotten a boast recently, with rumors that Apple’s AAPL next iPhone will include that technology. Hirson conceded that if the tech giant gets into the game — which he thinks won’t be for years — all of the players have a fierce competitor. “Apple is notorious for waiting to do something, then doing it right.”

But in the meantime, companies like Square continue to tackle the market for small merchants. They just got a little more competition.

196,"Wal-Mart is celebrating a surprisingly strong U.S. holiday season by spreading the wealth a bit.

The world’s largest retailer and the nation’s largest private employer is spending $1 billion to increase hourly wages for its current U.S. store associates to more than $9 per hour, or higher, beginning in April. That increase is at least $1.75 above the federally mandated minimum wage. The decision will impact thousands of full and part-time U.S. employees.

Here are some other key points from Wal-Mart’s latest earnings report.

What you need to know: Wal-Mart WMT , often maligned by labor advocates that have long argued the retailer can pay its employees more, is seemingly heeding that call. Even Fortune’s Stephen Gandel has argued Wal-Mart could afford to pay its employees up to 50% more without disappointing Wall Street.

Wal-Mart isn’t aiming as high as Gandel suggested, but it is certainly making a notable move with the increase. Wal-Mart said by February of next year, all current U.S. associates would make $10 an hour or more. The company is also piloting a training program to help employees move out of entry-level positions and potentially make $15 an hour and more with increased responsibilities. Wal-Mart employees about 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at its’ U.S. Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores.

The pay hike comes as Wal-Mart reported a strong 1.7% increase in U.S. same-store sales, a key metric for retailers. That was better than the 0.7% jump that analysts had anticipated, according to a poll conducted by Consensus Metrix.

“Our fourth quarter was the first positive traffic comp we’ve had since the third quarter of fiscal year 2013,” said Greg Foran, Wal-Mart U.S. president and CEO. Wal-Mart booted traffic during the critical six-week holiday season, resulting in strong sales of toys, home, seasonal and apparel goods. Wal-Mart completed almost 1 billion total transactions during the holiday season, including a particularly strong Cyber Monday.

The big number: Wal-Mart’s overall total revenue climbed 1.4% to $131.57 billion for the fiscal quarter ended January 31. That wasn’t as strong as the $132.28 billion projected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Wal-Mart’s top line results have frequently missed Wall Street’s expectations the past few years. Per-share adjusted earnings, meanwhile, totaled $1.61 versus the $1.54 predicted by analysts.

What you might have missed: While Wal-Mart ended the year on a high note, President and CEO Doug McMillion said “we’re not satisfied.” He and the leadership team says they want to continue to improve the customer experience, in part by better integrating physical stores with the company’s e-commerce and mobile commerce business.

“We have work to do to grow the business,” McMillion said. “We know what customers want from a shopping experience, and we’re investing strategically to exceed their expectations.”

Because of the higher wages and investments in training and e-commerce, Wal-Mart expects current-year operating profit to be pressured. Wal-Mart is spending about 20 cents per share for the full year on the higher wages and associate training and educational programs. As a result, Wal-Mart sees 2016 fiscal-year profit between $4.70 to $5.05 per share with sales expected to rise between 1% to 2%, hurt by some pressure from the stronger U.S. dollar.","The pay hike, which will cost $1 billion, comes as the world's largest retailer reports a strong holiday quarter.",Generated Summary: Wal-Mart is celebrating a surprisingly strong U.S. holiday season by spreading the wealth a bit.

199,"As cocktail culture continues to grow in the U.S., so does the alcohol market; unfortunately for Pernod Ricard SA, owners of Absolut, millennials’ tastes are shifting from vodka to bourbon.

This change has not yet affected the company’s profits, as it’s expected to post a 7.9% increase in sales and a 30% increase in net income on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reports. It helps that the company owns various alcohol brands aside from Absolute, including Jameson Irish whiskey and Martell cognac.

Liquor analyst Trevor Stirling tells the Journal that this shift away from vodka is “not universal gloom and doom, but they’re in a tough situation.”

Between 2010 and 2014, vodka consumption declined almost 2%. In the same period, whiskey sales rose 2.7%, and American bourbon and Tennessee whiskey both climbed nearly 17%. In the U.S. alone vodka sales went down 0.3%, whiskey went up 2.7%, and American bourbon and Tennessee whiskey rose 7.4%.

Half of Pernod’s U.S. sales come from Absolut, sales volumes of which declined 3.3% last quarter.

Diageo PLC is currently the world’s top liquor company. If Pernod wants to surpass Diageo, it’ll have to “find more pours in the high-value U.S. market” either by reinventing the Absolut brand, which Stirling says can take between three and five years, or via acquisitions.

Other world leaders sauntered down red-carpeted stairs during their arrival at the city of Hangzhou.

Trump was quick to declare it a snub by Chinese officials when talking at a function in Brook Park, Ohio.

202,"Dodgy trainers signing up students with no hope or intention of finishing courses will find the federal cash train no longer arriving under a total loans scheme revamp.

The federal government is scrapping entirely the loans program the Gillard government set up and replacing it with a tougher scheme it says will stop providers rorting the system and save taxpayers $7 billion.

""The scheme is fundamentally broken,"" Education Minister Simon Birmingham said on Wednesday.

Loans have blown out from $325 million in 2012 to $2.9 billion in 2015.

Scrapping the old program gives the government confidence it will be rid of ""rogue providers and shonky operators"" without the kind of legal challenges it's faced from recent crack downs.

The new program, which starts in January, will only support legitimate students undertaking worthwhile and value-for-money courses with quality training providers.

Courses must meet skills shortages and likely lead to students getting a job to be eligible for government-funded loans, capped at $5000, $10,000 or $15,000 depending on delivery costs.

Less than half the 800 vocational courses now attracting government loans are expected to stay eligible.

Taxpayers would no longer fund qualifications in areas like fashion styling, veterinary Chinese herbal medicine, arts counselling or energy healing, Senator Birmingham said.

The government's plans also include:

* bans on recruitment brokers and cold-calling potential students;

* requirements for students to show they're active; and

* powers to cap provider loan amounts and student numbers, and to suspend poor performing providers.

All private trainers will have to reapply to offer commonwealth-funded loans.

The application process will start even before legislation passes parliament.

Public trainers, including TAFEs, will automatically be allowed to offer government loans, although they will still face tough rules around course eligibility, students enrolments, completion rates and employment outcomes.

The minister said while most rorting had been among private trainers, TAFEs had not been exempt, with fewer than one in six students finishing courses at some public institutions.

TAFE Directors Australia said the tighter rules were welcome but the real test lay in their implementation.

""We do have concerns about the role of the department in overseeing this regime, given the experience of recent years,"" chief executive, Martin Riordan, said.

The peak body for private trainers said efforts to rebuild integrity in the sector were long overdue.

However some of the government's ""surprisingly anti-business"" package made no sense and could hurt quality providers and reduce student choice.

""Far from providing certainty for the thousands of private providers, it is almost inconceivable that sweeping reforms of this nature would be announced so late before implementation and without consultation,"" Australian Council for Private Education and Training boss Rod Camm said.

Senator Birmingham will have to steer legislation through parliament quickly, with five sitting weeks until year's end.

Labor wants to examine the plans in detail before a decision about its support.

The government had been dragged kicking and screaming to clean up some of the rorts but their new plan's still left ""opportunities for the shonks ... to drive a massive truck through the holes"", Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said.",The federal government is overhauling the system of commonwealth loans to vocational education students.,Generated Summary: Dodgy trainers signing up students with no longer arriving under a total loans scheme revamp.

One rebel official denied the report that al-Sakhour had fallen, an advance that would cut the rebel-held eastern districts of Aleppo in two, while another said the situation was not yet clear. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels had lost control of more than a third of eastern Aleppo in recent days.

Citing a military source, Syrian state TV said the army and its allies had seized the entire Sakhour area and were working to clear it of mines. Backed by allied militiamen, the army has been advancing into eastern Aleppo from the northeast since last week, making steady gains over the weekend.

A fighter on the government side in Aleppo said the army and its allies had now driven a wedge through eastern Aleppo, leaving a corridor for rebels to quit the northern part for the south.

""In the coming hours, the rest of the northern sector will be taken,"" the fighter told Reuters, declining to be identified because he is not an official spokesman.

Capturing rebel-held eastern Aleppo would be the biggest victory for President Bashar al-Assad since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Aleppo is the most important urban stronghold of the uprising.

Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman said government forces were now in effective control of a swathe of eastern Aleppo stretching north from the al-Sakhour neighbourhood, having seized a third of eastern Aleppo in recent days.

""It is the biggest defeat for the opposition in Aleppo since 2012,"" he told Reuters. Abdulrahman said the army and its allies were now in control of an entire swathe of eastern Aleppo stretching north from al-Sakhour.

He was sentenced to life in prison, but will be eligible for parole in nine years. Gibbs was also found guilty of 12 related charges, including taking body parts as trophies from corpses.

Three soldiers who have already pled guilty in the case testified against Gibbs, who was accused of masterminding a scheme to kill unarmed civilians and then plant weapons to make the deaths appear justified.

""Sergeant Gibbs had a charisma, he had a 'follow me' personality,"" prosecutor Maj. Robert Stelle said in closing arguments Wednesday. ""But it was all a bunch of crap. He had his own mission: murder and depravity.""

Gibbs's defense attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, had argued that the other witnesses had framed Gibbs for the deaths, and that some admitted they had been under the influence of hashish while serving in Afghanistan.

Gibbs, who testified in his own defense, denied murdering civilians, but did admit to taking trophies from Afghans he said were killed legitimately. He compared cutting fingers from his human kills to ""keeping antlers"" from deer he'd shot.

The five-member jury at the Army's Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Seattle deliberated for four hours before finding Gibbs guilty.

Twenty-six-year-old Gibbs, of Billings, Montana was among five soldiers from Lewis-McChord charged with taking part in the thrill kills in 2010 in a case that included allegations of widespread drug use, the collection of body parts and photos of the U.S. soldiers holding the Afghan bodies like hunter's trophies.

In a confession taped in May 2010 and obtained by ABC News, one of the soldiers admitted the team's role in the murders, but told Army investigators that Gibbs, his unit's ""crazy"" sergeant, had hatched the plan.

Morlock said that killing people came ""too easy"" to Gibbs.

The corporal said Gibbs gave orders to open fire on the civilian at the same time Gibbs threw a hand grenade at the victim.

""He pulled out one of his grenades, an American grenade, you know, popped it, throws it, tells me where to go to whack this guy, kill this guy, kill this guy,"" Morlock told the investigators.

Morlock said Sergeant Gibbs carried a Russian grenade to throw next to the body of the dead Afghan, to make it seem he was about to attack the American soldiers.

The corporal said he opened fire as directed, fearful of not following Gibbs' orders.

""It's definitely not the right thing to do,"" Morlock told the investigators. ""But I mean, when you got a squad leader bringing you into that, that type of real, that mindset, and he believes that you're on board with that, there's definitely no way you wanted him to think otherwise.""

205,"When it comes to U.S. tech employers, there’s Google, and then there’s everybody else.

Perched atop our list of the best places to work for the fifth straight year, the company attracts more than 2 million job applicants a year and hires only about 4,000 of them.

“It’s easier to get into MIT than it is to get hired by Google,” notes Tom Leung, who spent three years there as a product manager. “Google is very, very picky, because they can afford to be.” Leung is founder and CEO of Poachable, a job site launched just two months ago that aims, as the name suggests, to match companies that have IT job openings with “passive” candidates who are already working elsewhere but might be open to better offers.

When Leung’s team surveyed thousands of techies to ask who they’d most want to be poached by, 55% picked Google—five times as many as would entertain an offer from second-place Apple (11%), and seven times the 8% who want to work for Amazon. Says Leung, “I expected Google to come out on top, but I was surprised by how huge the gap is.”

A big part of Google’s appeal is that it’s “an engineer’s dream,” says Leung. “Engineers really want to work on hard technical challenges, like self-driving cars, drones, and wearable technology.” Obviously, most companies aren’t making those things. Even so, any company can match Google, or at least come close, in other respects. Leung says almost all the 2,000 techies who have signed on to Poachable so far are looking for three things: work-life balance, generous pay, and a clear career path.

“When we ask IT people, ‘What are your must-have criteria for a new job?’ almost all of them mention time for a life outside of work,” says Leung. “Certain tech companies are known for expecting everyone to work 70 hours a week and sucking all the energy right out of people so they have nothing left over.” To attract tech talent, don’t get that reputation, Leung suggests. “Keep an eye on the number of hours people are working.”

Below-market pay is another reason techies sign up to be poached, as is the lack of “interesting career prospects,” he says. Google gets high marks for both—but so can other employers, many of whom aren’t even tech companies.

The biggest reason not to worry about competing with Google, Leung says, is simply that you probably don’t need the same people. “Google is like the Olympics, but not every team does better with an Olympic athlete on it,” he points out. “You may be better off with a strong, seasoned player who has the particular skills you happen to need.”

Employers will also have to get used to the idea that “talent is temporary these days. IT people get so many job offers that any company has to be prepared to lose some of them,” he says. “The employers on Poachable have told me they feel a little guilty about ‘stealing’ talent from other companies. But then, they’re well aware that some of their own employees have signed up, too.”","But that's okay, says a former Google executive, because companies that need tech talent aren't competing for the same people.","Generated Summary: When it comes to U.S. tech employers, there’s Google, there’s Google, and then there’s everybody else."

Google goog already has its largest engineering office outside the U.S. in Zurich. Emmanuel Mogenet, the head of Google Research in Europe, said in a Thursday blog post that the location was ideal due to Europe being “home to some of the world’s premier technical universities.”

“We look forward to collaborating with all the excellent computer science research that is coming from the region, and hope to contribute towards the wider academic community through our publications and academic support,” he wrote.

The new research group will focus on machine intelligence (covering everything from speech recognition to ranking), natural language processing and understanding (not only useful for things like translation, but also search), and machine perception (tasks like searching for things in photos and recognizing handwriting).

208,"Google has its sights set on Apple Watch, according to a new report.

The Alphabet-owned Google GOOGL is currently building two Android Wear-based devices that will feature circular displays, and come in two sizes, depending on customer preference, Android Police is reporting, citing sources it claims are reliable. It’s unclear at this point whether the smartwatches would come with the Nexus branding Google uses on its smartphones or feature other names.

While Google declined comment, the move would represent a major change in tack for the company. While Android Wear, Google’s wearables operating system, has been available since March 2014, the company hasn’t launched its own hardware running the operating system. Instead, it’s relied upon third-party companies, including LG and Samsung, among others, to make hardware and promote Android Wear to users.

Meanwhile, Google has been working at improving Android Wear’s features and boosting its position in what is a fast-growing but still fledgling industry. By doing so, it’s stayed away from competing with hardware makers.

However, while Apple AAPL has not released its Apple Watch sales figures, most market analysts say it’s far ahead of the pack. Some have even pegged Apple Watch’s market share at 80%, and one analyst, Neil Cybart, argues that Apple’s wearables division alone could be worth $10 billion—an impressive feat, considering the Apple Watch launched last year.

Apparently watching Apple Watch soar past Android Wear, Google is now reportedly planning to jump into the fray with compelling alternatives, Android Police’s sources say. They claim the first smartwatch, currently codenamed Angelfish, will have a smooth case that “curves where the watch band meets the body.” In addition, it’ll feature three buttons, though it’s unclear what they’ll be used for. It’s also the larger of the two, featuring a diameter of 43.5mm, the report claims. It’s larger size will help it accommodate a larger battery and an LTE chip that will let it connect to cellular networks.

Those same sources say Google’s second watch is called Swordfish. Details were a little slim on Swordfish, but the device will come with a “different button arrangement,” feature three colors (silver, titanium, and rose gold), and have a smaller footprint than Angelfish. It also won’t have LTE connectivity or even GPS for tracking movement, the report claims.

For more about Apple, watch:

Still, several questions remain. it’s unclear what firm Google might work with to manufacture the smartwatches, and it’s unknown when (or even if) they’ll launch. Android Police’s sources say the most likely unveiling date will come when Google showcases its Nexus smartphones later this year. The sources didn’t say what price points Google is aiming for.

Regardless, it appears Google is at least considering joining the smartwatch fray and taking on market leader Apple Watch.

It’s time for a battle.

209,"When it comes to spring allergies, the amount of Kleenex one goes through varies year to year, often depending on Mother Nature, personal triggers and where you live.

Worst place for sufferers? Tulsa, Okla.

That’s according to a report out today from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. A not-for-profit organization that provides information, community-based services and a support network, it has culled 2006 data and ranked the worst cities for spring allergies based on three factors: pollen counts, medication usage by allergy patients and the number of board-certified allergists per patient.

Tulsa-based Dr. Rollie Rhodes, allergy director for the Eastern Oklahoma Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic, isn’t surprised his area tops the list.

He estimates that he and his colleagues saw several hundred more patients than usual last year because of the mild 2005-06 winter, which allowed the ragweed season to last longer than normal and the spring tree season to start up in February.

“The milder the winter,” he says, “the more problems.”

Dallas-Forth Worth, Texas, which had a couple of mild winters in recent years that helped plants thrive, came in second.

Last year, based on data from 2005, Hartford, Conn., had the worst spring allergies, according to the list. That could have been due to temperature changes or too few allergy doctors to handle a particularly heavy patient load.

But normally, Southeastern cities rule. Trees that produce lots of pollen, such as oak, maple and elm, are popular in the Southeast, and the open environment makes it easy for lightweight spores to travel once they’re airborne, says Angel Waldron, spokeswoman for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. And then there’s the weather–short, mild winters and long springs don’t help.

Time to Move? One of the reasons the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America first began tracking in 2003 the intensity of seasonal allergies was because the group was getting so many calls from people asking where they should move to avoid them. The goal was to put research behind its answers.

“They’d say, ‘I moved to Atlanta, and I never had troubles before. Now I’m miserable,’ ” Waldron says.

But while it’s helpful, for instance, for people with tree pollen allergies to know that the Southeast might not be a great place for them to live, relocating won’t solve most sufferers’ problems.

Most people tend to have more than one trigger, something they may not realize until they move to another city and are exposed to different allergens. People with tree pollen allergies could move to Seattle, for example, where the tree pollen count is much lower, only to find out they’re also allergic to mold, a significant problem in the Northwest.

Some seek solace in Arizona. But Dr. Michael Daines, an immunologist and assistant professor in pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, says the people who initially moved to the desert to escape their allergies basically brought allergens with them, planting Bermuda grass and other non-native plants. Tucson, the fifth worst city for spring allergies, is having another bad spring so far this year, he says.

Allergy Busters If allergies are making you miserable, experts recommend avoiding unnecessary exposure to allergens; consistently taking medication, such as an antihistamine or decongestant; or seeing a doctor–if you can get an appointment this time of year.

The wait time to get into Daines’ allergy clinic, for instance, is currently months long.

“It’s nice to be in demand, but our main goal is to get rid of the suffering,” he says. “Patients are really suffering.”

211,"The rebound of the U.S. automotive market in 2014 has been marked by particularly strong sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, consistent with the affection many American motorists have for large vehicles.

Moderating fuel prices nationwide are stoking sales, as well as demand for new vehicles to replace those that have been on the road an average of 11 years. Consumer confidence has been at multi-year high levels, and the jobs picture has improved steadily as well.

Hybrids and battery-powered cars, by contrast, lately have struggled with a few exceptions, notably Nissan’s Leaf electric vehicle, up nearly 25% through the first ten months of the year. Toyota’s popular Prius hybrid is down more than 11% for the year.

Overall, vehicle sales rose 6% in October from a year ago and are on track to reach a total of between 16.4 million and 16.5 million by the end of the year. Ford Motor Co F said utility vehicles and trucks accounted for 72% of its sales for the month, up from 68.5 percent a year ago.

Fred Diaz, Nissan’s senior vice president of sales and marketing for North America, told the Wall Street Journal “when you look at the economic indicators, everything is either positive or neutral. We all know there still is a huge pent-up demand out there.”

Gasoline prices are averaging below $3 a gallon nationwide for the first time in three years. The drop alleviates worry that consumers will get hit in their pocketbooks each time they fill up; it also provides extra cash to household budgets. But the low fuel prices also could portend economic trouble.

“Initially, (a lower oil price) will provide a boost to an economy that already has some momentum,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial told the Associated Press. “It’s like a tax cut. The problem is that it will come back to haunt us in 2015″ to the extent it reflects a weakening global economy.

Of the five top-selling vehicle models in October, three were fullsize pickups – Ford F150, Chevrolet Silverado and Ram – one was a small crossover, the Honda CR-V. Toyota Camry was the only car to crack the top five.

Through the first 10 months of the year, vehicles classified as light trucks accounted for 51.6% of the U.S. market, while 48.4% were passenger cars.

Minivans, up nearly 6% this year, are half as popular proportionately as they were a decade ago. Minivans have been overtaken by new crossover models that provide more room for passengers. Crossovers are based on car architectures, making them lighter than minivans or truck-based sport-utility vehicles. The minivan sector is dominated by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCA , whose Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town and Country models account for half the market.

Federal and state regulators have tightened fuel-efficiency restrictions while providing incentives to manufacturers of alternative-fuel vehicles such as the Leaf to reduce consumption of energy. The initiatives have worked to make vehicles lighter and to make their propulsion systems more energy efficient.

But the government hasn’t stifled American preferences for big vehicles.","Fullsize pickups gain sales momentum, but is it fleeting?",Generated Summary: The rebound of the U.S.
212,"The announcement that Verizon is buying AOL has the financial media buzzing more for what it says about the future of the media and telecom businesses than for the pure size of the deal.

After all, as my colleague Geoff Smith noted this morning, the $4.4 billion Verizon VZ is paying for AOL AOL amounts to “loose change” for the nation’s largest wireless provider.

At the same time, it does offer the opportunity to check in on the M&A market in 2015, which has been active and looks like it will heat up even more as the year goes on.

According to Dealogic, the total volume of global mergers and acquisition volume came in at roughly $3.5 trillion in 2014 — beating the 2013 totals by a healthy 26%. Total deal volumes in 2015 are at $1.4 trillion including Verizon’s acquisition of AOL. That’s the fastest pace we’ve seen since 2007, and if the wheeling and dealing keeps up at this rate, the total number of deals could outstrip every year on record other than 2007.

There are several reasons for the boom. Stock markets are getting pricey, giving executives plenty of firepower to finalize deals. At the same time, interest rates are at record lows, making deals like Verizon’s–which was funded with commercial paper–relatively inexpensive. Meanwhile, corporate executives are facing slow-growing markets in the rich world, with apparently few opportunities to invest in their own operations to create shareholder value. So, the next best option is to buy someone else’s operations.

Whether or not you agree with this particular management strategy, examining the M&A cycle can tell us something about the economy in general. Take a look at this chart from Generational Equity, which shows the M&A cycle going back to 1980:

M&A activity tends to peak in the year or two before the economy contracts (recessions are indicated by the shaded areas in the chart). Given that 2015 deal volume is on pace to surpass 2014 figures by about 11%, one might get worried that M&A levels are reaching a danger zone, signaling a coming stock market bubble and possible recession.

But another point to take from the above chart is that M&A volumes have surpassed previous peaks before each of the past three recessions. It still doesn’t appear as if M&A is on pace to surpass the 2007 record of $4.6 trillion in deals. Of course that may change, with big deals rumored, like the $40 billion hostile offer that pharmaceutical firm Teva made to Mylan (which is in turn offering nearly $30 billion for Perrigo) last month. But for the time being, it looks like the M&A market has a few more years to ramp up before the next recession. That’s good news, considering our current economic expansion is one of the longest running on record. But it pays to keep track of these trends, as it may just help you spot the next serious downturn.",A look at M&A cycles and what they say about the future of the U.S. economy,Generated Summary: The announcement that Verizon is buying AOL has the financial media buzzing more for what it says about the future of the media and telecom businesses than for the pure size of the deal.
213,"Prime Minister David Cameron's hope that Britain would join air strikes against Islamic State group targets in Syria is fading due to the likely election of anti-war campaigner Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the opposition Labour Party.

After parliament returns on Monday, Cameron's government had hoped to call a vote on the issue in a bid to extend Britain's current role in coalition air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

But Corbyn, a leading opponent to the 2003 Iraq war who wants to apologise over the conflict if elected leader of Britain's main opposition party on September 12, is deeply opposed to the move.

""I will only proceed going further on this issue if there is genuine consensus in the United Kingdom about it before going back to parliament,"" Cameron said during a press conference on Friday.

Cameron stressed that military action against IS was part of the ""comprehensive program"" he envisages to tackle the migrants crisis which has resulted in thousands of people, including many Syrians, flocking to Europe.

MPs in parliament's foreign affairs committee are due to discuss possible air strikes on Tuesday.

The prime minister cannot secure the necessary parliamentary approval for air strikes without opposition support due to a slim parliamentary majority and the opposition of some of his own MPs.

""He thinks there is a case for taking further action against ISIL (another term for IS) but he would prefer to proceed in a consensual way,"" Cameron's spokeswoman told reporters recently.

This looks impossible under a Corbyn leadership.

""I'm not convinced that air strikes in Syria will do any good other than kill a lot of civilians and other people,"" Corbyn said at a campaign event last week.

Cameron's government was defeated on taking military action in Syria in 2013 in one of the most damaging foreign policy blows to his previous coalition government.

If Corbyn is elected Labour leader as expected, it could also pose wider and highly sensitive problems on defence for Cameron.

Asked if there were any circumstances under which he would deploy military forces abroad during a debate on Thursday, Corbyn said: ""I'm sure there are some. But I can't think of them at the moment.""

Corbyn, who was a leading figure in the Stop The War Coalition, which organised one of Britain's biggest ever rallies against the Iraq conflict in 2003, also wants to scrap Britain's nuclear deterrent.

214,"A seven-year-old startup out of Atlanta plans to launch an app that will offer on-demand trash pick up, similar to how the Uber app can provide a ride service. The Uber comparison isn’t just a metaphor — the company has hired the founding CTO of Uber, Oscar Salazar, as its chief technology advisor and to help launch the app.

The company is called Rubicon Global and it manages a network of independent waste haulers, who bid on picking up trash from business customers like 7-Eleven and Wegmans. The company claims to offer businesses lower trash bills and using its software can more efficiently find places to recycle, resell and haul off the garbage.

Co-founder and CEO Nate Morris, who landed on Fortune’s list of ’40 under 40′ in 2014, is a major Republican power broker and hails from Lexington, Kentucky. Morris told Fortune in 2014 that the company could aim to go public in 2016.

With this new mobile app, Rubicon Global is looking to move beyond its business customer base. The company says ordering a garbage pick up won’t be as quick as ordering an Uber car, which usually takes just several minutes to arrive. The Rubicon Global app will probably take closer to a few hours, or even the next day, when it first launches.

Down the road, the company hopes the on-demand trash pick up process will take closer to 30 minutes. The app is currently in beta testing.

Rubicon Global is an example of a startup that’s using mobile tech, data, algorithms and a distributed work force to try to disrupt an industry that hasn’t traditionally used all that much technology: the garbage business. The trash industry is dominated by really big players like Waste Management.

Rubicon’s software finds the best ways to keep more trash out of landfills, and the company’s system also uses sensors and manual sorting to figure out what parts of the company’s waste stream can be recycled and resold. In addition the company is testing dumpster-mounded cameras to monitor the trash process remotely.

These days on-demand startups are offering almost any service you can think up from on-demand groceries, to instant access weed, to ultra easy shipping delivery. The on-demand economy has even garnered spoofs about the entitled elite of San Francisco using their disposable income to create a ‘servant economy.’

Rubicon Global’s new app — which should be available in “a few months” says Wired — is not to be mistaken with Trash Day, a website that says it will take your trash out to the curb for you for a fee. It’s still not clear if Trash Day is an actual operating business, and not another silver spoon-style spoof.

Rubicon Global raised $30 million earlier this year from investors including SalesForce founder and CEO Marc Benioff. The company’s investors include El Paso Advisors, QuarterMoore, Richmond Global, Rotunda Capital Partners, and Spouting Rock Financial Partners.",It's the brain child of a Georgia-based garbage startup and the former CTO of Uber.,"Generated Summary: A seven-year-old startup out of Atlanta plans to launch an app that will offer on-demand trash pick up, similar to how the Uber app can provide a ride service.

Lord Mayor Robert Doyle on Thursday unveiled plans to reduce car access to the busy south end of Elizabeth Street, adding more greenery and walking paths and providing better access to public transport.

A 100m southbound section of the street, from Flinders Lane to Flinders St would be blocked to cars.

But that is not nearly enough for the RACV public policy manager Brian Negus, who wants the centre of Melbourne turned into a ""proper, interconnected, European-style mall"".

Negus says the car ban should go all the way from Flinders St to the Bourke St Mall shopping precinct.

The San Francisco medical examiner's office said an investigation was pending, with the results to be announced in 14 to 16 weeks.

By 1998, when Mr. Perry designed the magazine's format, the ESPN sports television network had raised its visibility through novel advertising graphics that included contemporary conceits like blurred and overlapping type, color-saturated images and surreal illustrations. While not exactly copying those ads, Mr. Perry also introduced playful typography and witty photographs that underscored the editorial concept that ESPN was something of a Rolling Stone of sports magazines, in which athletes were presented as rock stars.

ESPN's larger-than-usual format had more visual impact than its competitors' publications, and with Mr. Perry's unconventional emphasis on big and dramatic photos it quickly drew more attention. He also used a film-strip approach of many small photos moving across a page or two pages, giving the magazine a TV-like air.

In its first year of publication, ESPN Magazine won the National Magazine Award for Design.

Floyd Darrin Perry was born on April 9, 1965, in Durham, N.C. After studies at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Parsons School of Design in New York City.

He started his career as a designer at Condé Nast Traveler and later became creative director of design at Broadband Sports Interactive. Before moving to ESPN he was an art editor at Sports Illustrated and creative director of Wired, which he redesigned.

Mr. Perry is survived by his mother, Pat Dennis Isaacs of Arden, N.C.; his father, Floyd E. Perry, and stepmother, Amy, of Durham; a sister, Debra Egan of Orlando, Fla.; and his partner, Jonathan Manzo of San Francisco.

According to author George Anders, a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor at The Wall Street Journal, most big companies make comparable mistakes all the time. For a new book, The Rare Find: Spotting Exceptional Talent Before Everyone Else, Anders set out to analyze how some of the most successful enterprises choose extraordinary new hires.

What he found will come as no surprise to anyone who has worked with someone who looked good on paper but turned out to be less than stellar in action.

Instead of insisting on a rigid set of credentials, Anders says, hiring managers ought to focus on what the job really requires and give a fair shot to candidates whose resumes may be what Anders calls “jagged,” or full of ups and downs.

Someone whose background “appears to teeter on the edge between success and failure,” he writes, can do “spectacular work in the right settings, where their strengths dramatically outweigh their flaws.”

Consider, for example, legendary Facebook engineer Evan Priestley. He had changed his college major three times before dropping out altogether, and was working as a low-level web designer at a small firm in Portland, Me., when, in 2007, he happened to come across a programming puzzle that Facebook had put out over the Internet. Priestley’s solution was so elegant that Facebook flew him to Palo Alto for an interview, where he impressed everyone with his skills.

Facebook hired him, and the rest is legend: Priestley led a team of programmers that sped up Facebook’s infrastructure and made it easier to add games, maps, and other applications.

At one point, Facebook’s site stopped working for a small group of users who, it turned out, were hampered by an obscure, out-of-date security program. The only publicly available manual was written in Danish. No problem! Priestley and a coworker stayed up all night learning enough Danish — mastering terms like foutmelding and beveilaging — to untangle the trouble.

The point: If hiring managers had considered only Priestley’s lackluster resume, he’d never have gotten a foot in the door.

Drawing on other case studies from organizations as diverse as the FBI, the National Basketball Association, General Electric GE , and (a cautionary tale) Enron, this is thought-provoking stuff for anybody who’s frustrated with trying to find exceptional talent using the same, tired old methods.

224,"If rhetoric were the primary measure of progress, at least one utility-industry leader would win high marks for moving from the old world of simply generating electricity to the newer, more complicated world of working with newfangled partners to manage it.

Ted Craver, CEO of the big Southern California utility company Edison International EIX , told an audience at Fortune’s Brainstorm E conference in Austin, Texas on Tuesday that his industry is in transition. It once emphasized power production. Now it operates “the network that connects homes and businesses.” Utilities always have been network operators. But now that new entrants are in the electricity market—such as homeowners who generate solar power from rooftop panels—utilities increasingly need to play middleman. Said Craver: “That’s a natural place for utilities to be.”

Craver said good utilities are focused on the desires of their customers, eliciting some chuckles from the audience. His comment provoked a gentle rebuke as well from Lynn Jurich, CEO of solar-panel leasing firm Sunrun RUN , who praised Craver but noted that utilities had challenged Sunrun in 40 instances. (Utilities tangle with rooftop installers over the impact they have on legacy electric systems.)

The executives spoke on a panel about the impact renewable energy is having in various spheres. John Woolard, who manages energy projects for Google GOOG , said 2,000 employees drive electric vehicles to work each day, presenting unique challenges around charging-station provisioning. Woolard also said Google has made $2 billion worth of investments in renewable energy projects, typically in situations where traditional capital would be difficult to raise. (An example: the Shepherds Flats wind farm in eastern Oregon.)

Google’s goals in making these investments, Woolard said, are “great returns and to advance decarbonization of the power supply.”

As a final note, that word, decarbonization, was everywhere at Brainstorm E and was new to me. It strikes me as an evolution of the language of the climate-change crowd, and a helpful one. Carbon as a fuel isn’t going away just yet. But decarbonization remains the goal as a means to the end of a cleaner environment.

225,"WASHINGTON — The push to impose criminal penalties on auto executives who fail to disclose deadly automobile defects hit another roadblock last week when a Senate committee voted down such a proposal.

Lawmakers and safety advocates who were pushing to institute criminal penalties for such behavior expressed dismay as that and a series of other auto safety reforms — including barring used-car dealers from selling vehicles with unrepaired recalls — also failed to proceed.

“Hiding these deadly defects with near impunity is what the industry has succeeded in doing,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who introduced several provisions that were voted down.

A few measures like raising the maximum civil penalty on automakers from $35 million to $70 million won approval, however. Republicans also agreed to give the Obama administration the funding increases it had requested for certain National Highway Traffic Safety Administration programs, provided the agency first adopts all of the inspector general’s recent recommendations.

A record year for auto recalls has led to multiple congressional hearings since last spring: Victims recounted their stories of injuries and lost loved ones, and auto executives came under withering criticism from lawmakers.

But despite the attention on Capitol Hill, new legislation has largely gone nowhere, as automakers’ lobbyists flexed their muscles to keep new regulations and penalties from moving forward — a task made easier for the lobbyists by the switch to a Republican-controlled Senate in January.

On Wednesday, in the same room where many of the hearings had taken place, the United States Senate committee on commerce met to complete its contribution to the huge transportation bill that Republican leaders intend to take to the floor this month.

The transportation funding bill is the last viable chance for the current Congress to pass auto safety reform, aides on both sides say. As a result, lawmakers vied during the meeting to attach auto safety provisions to it — a common tactic for passing legislation that had otherwise stalled.

But one after another, Democratic senators’ proposals were defeated. The exception was a measure to ban rental companies from renting cars with unrepaired safety recalls. Still, a similar proposal to prevent used-car dealers from doing the same failed on a party-line vote. (The committee’s chairman, John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said that banning used-car dealers from selling recalled cars “could have unintended consequences,” like complicating trade-ins.)

As for making it a specific crime to knowingly conceal information on safety defects, that, too, failed. Three Democrats — Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Gary Peters of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia — joined the Republican majority in blocking it.

The auto industry resisted what it said was “criminalizing the business of manufacturing” in a document that auto lobbyists circulated to lawmakers before Wednesday’s meeting. (The lack of criminal statutes has complicated efforts by federal prosecutors to bring charges against individual employees at General Motors over the cover-up of faulty ignition switches.)

Mr. Thune tried to highlight several auto provisions that made the cut, like the increase in the civil fine maximum to $70 million, an increase in certain funding and the rental car proposal.

But most Democrats, irritated by what they said was a lack of any real negotiating, were having none of it as the meeting concluded. Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said the group was “breaking a long tradition” of committee bipartisanship on safety issues.

Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, became so discouraged that he withdrew two of his proposals before they could be voted down — saying he would most likely propose them as amendments directly on the Senate floor.

For now, congressional staff members from both parties say that behind-the-scenes negotiations will continue until the bill reaches the Senate floor. It is possible that at least a handful of the defeated auto safety reforms could still be resurrected.

A Republican aide with knowledge of the negotiations said proposals that had received unified Democratic support during Wednesday’s meeting were more likely to be considered than those in which Democratic senators broke off.

226,"A Brisbane coffee shop owner has been swamped with support after saying she didn't mind if a customer who changed her baby's nappy twice at a table while people were eating never returned.

The mother of a newborn wrote a scathing review on Google about Park Bench Espresso Bar in Bulimba for the reception she received for changing her baby in front of diners.

The review, attributed to Stephanie Plahn, first praises the quality of the coffee before taking aim at owner Jocelyn Ridgway and other customers.

She says her baby is 12-weeks old and that she put a mat down before changing the nappy.

""I approached her (the manager) upon leaving and asked if she had a problem with my baby and I sitting there. She said in quite a critical tone, that she didn't think it was appropriate to change my baby there,"" the review states.

""To this woman and the 2 other customers who made comments regarding this. Mothers don't need your judgment or criticism. We have enough pressure and stress we deal with on a daily basis. We rarely get the opportunity to get out and have a coffee amidst the long list of things we are doing for our families every single day.

""I am sorry (not sorry) you are so terribly offended by a tiny baby's tiny little dirty nappy that you think it necessary to criticise.""

The store's Google reviews have exploded from a handful to almost 40 with almost everyone dumping on Ms Plahn.

""5 stars for not backing down when you were challenged by the lady with the dirty nappy! I would be disgusted if someone changed a nappy while I ate,"" wrote Alana Templeton.

Another customer wrote ""I just wanted to support the owner against the selfish arrogant self entitled post"", while Sharna Allen posted ""I am so ashamed of my self absorbed generation! show some respect for people around!""

(Via the ""Is It Child Friendly"" blog)

Ms Ridgway told AAP the lady was at the coffee shop for two hours last Friday.

""She was there that long the baby did two poos,"" Ms Ridgway said.

""There were people next to her. We had complaints from a group of older women who did not think it was that great.""

The coffee shop is an extension of Green Grass and Home Body retail store which Ms Ridgway started 15 years ago.

The al fresco area opened up in 2011 and a park, with several sheltered tables, is located directly across the road.

Since Ms Ridgway shared the review on Facebook with friends, she's said she's had nothing but support.

""I know in my heart that that was not cool. It's an etiquette thing. She won't be back as a customer, that's fine.

227,"From ratings records and Oscar nominations, to underinflated balls and the Golden Globes, 2015 kicked off with widespread buzz on social media.

Starting off the year on a high note, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas took place Jan. 6-9 and was the source of more than 515,000 social media posts, a 105 percent increase year over year, according to social media insights firm Mashwork. A majority of these conversations took place on—surprise—Twitter, while Google's Android came in as the most buzzed-about brand at this year's CES, appearing in 5 percent of tweets.

But CES wasn't all that dominated social media that week.

The Jan. 6 premiere of Fox's new hip-hop drama ""Empire"" had 9.8 million viewers, making it the network's highest-rated series debut in three years. Pulling in a 3.7 rating among adults ages 18-49, ""Empire"" even surpassed ABC's ""Modern Family"" as the top-rated show in the demo. In addition, the show's premiere pulled in seven times the number of emotional tweets versus the average premiere, with almost 90,000 reactions.

Meanwhile, after more than four decades making films, Woody Allen stated that he ""has no idea where to begin"" on his freshly announced Amazon produced televison series. Fans took to Twitter to share their opinions on Allen's first TV series, with 28 percent of users expressing love and 13 percent citing the deal as ""brilliant.""

Kim Kardashian who? Justin Bieber's Calvin Klein ad broke the Internet with 23,000 reactions in the 24 hours after his campaign launched. According to the Daily Mail, his shoot got five times more social media mentions than Kardashian's Paper cover. Although Photoshop speculation has been surrounding the ads, Bieber's appearance sparked the hashtag #mycalvins, which generated 1.6 million Twitter mentions in the first 48 hours.

On the film front, ""The Lego Movie"" took home the best snub award. CNN Money reported that while the film grossed $257 million and holds a 96 percent fresh rating on movie review site Rotten Tomatoes—a higher score than ""Frozen,"" last year's best animated feature winner—the movie did not receive an Oscar nomination.

After the announcement, a clever tweet from co-director Philip Lord lit up the Twitterverse with more than 34,000 retweets of an Oscar made of legos. Although the film itself missed out on a nomination, its original song, ""Everything is Awesome"" did snag a nomination for best song.

Later that same week, ""American Sniper,"" made by Warner Bros., became the biggest January opening weekend in box-office history. Despite controversy surrounding the film, ""American Sniper"" brought in nearly $90 million and 355,000 tweets; more than 74 percent of reactions expressed love or excitement.

228,"Peter Schiff and Mark Dow disagree on the long-term outlook for gold, but that's not the only thing they take opposite sides on.

In a passionate and charged debate on Thursday's episode of ""Futures Now,"" Schiff and Dow presented divergent views on the Fed, government data and inflation. And interestingly, each of these disagreements came together to paint a picture of why they see gold going in different directions.

First of all, while Dow, author of the Behavioral Macro blog, sees gold going higher before it drops much lower, he says that the only way to gauge the action in gold is by looking at sentiment.

""The longer-term view on gold is still bearish,"" Dow said. ""I think ultimately the economy will improve, rates will go higher, we're not going to get the inflation that a few people still fear, and that will mean that the second half of the gold bubble will melt. But it's hard to tell if we're at that point now, or if that point comes a few months out.""

For Dow, ""gold is the ultimate psychological trade. It's the ultimate sentiment-driven asset. It's not about fundamentals. There are no fundamentals. ... So you really have to go by how the sentiment is manifest in the market, and whether or not it's at an extreme.""

Dow believes that sentiment is now neither especially bullish nor exceptionally bearish, making it difficult to predict gold's next move.

But Schiff's take is very different.

""I disagree with just about everything that Mark said with respect to his comments on sentiment,"" Schiff responded. ""I still think the sentiment is quite negative on gold. Maybe not as negative as it was, but very few people believe in this rally ... so I think the sentiment still favors higher gold prices.""

""The fundamentals have favored higher gold prices all along,"" Schiff continued. ""It's just that most people don't understand how great [the fundamentals] are. They believe the myth of the U.S. recovery. They believe the Fed can actually unwind its balance sheet, that it can end QE, that it can raise interest rates and that the economy is going to keep on expanding. None of that is going to happen. It's all fantasy. ""

But Dow says that Schiff's understanding of the Fed is fundamentally flawed.

""I think what people really haven't been understanding and are slowly coming around to is how the transmission of monetary policy actually works. A lot of people way back in 2009, 2010 started predicting inflation, an explosion of yields, a collapse in the dollar—a whole series of things that didn't manifest themselves. Now people are starting to learn that, wait a minute, printing money does not lead to inflation automatically,"" Dow said.","Is gold set to skyrocket, or is it doomed?

But the man they believe is Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje - better known as Mumbai gangster Chhota Rajan - is denying his identity.

Nikalje's luck ran out when he arrived in Bali on Sunday, where authorities were waiting after a tip-off from Interpol in Canberra.

The 55-year-old is wanted in India for up to 20 murders, as well as weapons and organised crime offences.

Bali provincial police spokesman Herry Wiyanto told reporters he entered Indonesia on a Sydney-issued Indian passport.

It had the number contained in the Interpol ""red notice"", but with the name Mohan Kumar.

""Because his passport number is in the red notice and from his face, we believe he's Rajendra,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

""We suspect he forged his name in order for him to hide and this is what we are investigating.""

Denpasar district detective chief Reinhard Habonaran Nainggolan says Australian authorities were aware Nikalje was living there for seven years.

Months ago, one-time hedge funder and pharmaceutical executive Shkreli was branded the “most hated man in America” after hiking the cost of his HIV drug, Daraprim, by 5,000%. The price hike brought both regulatory scrutiny and public outrage, widening the spotlight to the pharmaceutical industry at large. Shkreli was later charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission and resigned as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. He was even voted Fortune’s fourth-most disappointing leader in March.

On Thursday, the 33-year-old, who has been known to flaunt his wealth, took to Twitter to rant about Trump, specifically, about Trump’s attitude regarding his affluence.

Just a warning—strong language ahead.

235,"It is a testament to Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell’s dogged preparedness that he is poised to blow out his primary in Kentucky on Tuesday.

McConnell’s victory was not always as much of a sure thing. Businessman Matt Bevin was the first serious primary challenger McConnell has drawn in five reelection campaigns. Bevin raised $3.7 million, nearly $1 million of it in his own money, enough to buy a healthy amount of broadcast advertising in the Bluegrass State and to fund a plane to crisscross Kentucky in the final days of campaigning.

But the Tea Party darling never really gained traction, consistently trailing McConnell in the polls by more than 25 percentage points. This was partly due to McConnell’s careful trek right on key positions, the hiring of Rand Paul’s campaign manager Jesse Benton to court the Tea Party crowd and the methodical opposition research on Bevin and his allies.

“Bevin was not to be taken lightly as a Tea Party primary foe, and McConnell didn’t,” says Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “After nearly 30 years in the Senate, McConnell has built up critics even among some GOP base voters in Kentucky, and his favorability ratings are just so-so. But his aggressive, full-on campaign, combined with Bevin’s inexperience and errors, should deliver a strong primary result for the incumbent.”

McConnell effectively painted Bevin as a flip flopper who once supported bank bailouts and lied about his resume. (Bevin once claimed on his LinkedIn page to have graduated from MIT but the school denied he was ever enrolled). McConnell also targeted outside groups that had the audacity to support Bevin, making it clear those groups would have a hard time finding work in Washington and in other races should they continue to support rifts within the Republican Party. “Some Washington- and Los Angeles-based groups have spent millions in total propping up a candidate who it appears had little actual grassroots momentum in Kentucky,” says Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Senatorial Campaign Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the Senate.

Indeed, McConnell spent more than $12 million on his primary not so much to beat Bevin, but to unite his fractured party both nationally and in Kentucky and to test-drive his campaign apparatus ahead of what will be a bruising general election. McConnell enters the general election essentially tied in polls with his likely Democratic opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a 35-year-old relative political ingénue who makes 72-year-old McConnell look, well, old. “Over $4 million of negative ads have already been aired against Alison and she has only just gone up on the air, yet she remains popular and in a strong position with lots of room to grow,” says Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the Senate. “Alison is a great candidate and we are in a terrific position to win.”

A test-drive was a wise move given the McConnell campaign’s gaffe-filled roll out. Early on, Benton was caught on tape saying he was “holding his nose” working for McConnell. The leader also had a series of television ad flubs. Some stock footage of the senator and his wife uploaded on YouTube ended up the brunt of late night comedians. And another ad accidentally featured footage of basketball rival Duke instead of the University of Kentucky’s team.

Still, “McConnell managed to stay a step ahead of his opponent,” says Jennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report. “The primary hasn’t damaged McConnell the way Democrats hoped. In fact, it might have put him in a stronger position.” Given that this race is poised to be the most expensive in Senate history—with more than $100 million pouring into the state—McConnell is taking nothing for granted in what has become the political fight of his career.","A day before the primary election in Kentucky, polls show Mitch McConnell has a commanding lead over his primary opponent, Matt Bevin. Now the real fight for his seat begins.",Generated Summary: It is a testament to Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell’s dogged preparedness that he is poised to blow out his primary in Kentucky on Tuesday.

One million of the shares were issued by the company; 5.4 million shares of the offering come from existing shareholders, including its largest, San Antonio-based United States Automobile Association. Scott Painter, TrueCar founder and chief executive, bought $500,000 worth of stock.

The secondary offering coincided with expiration of the so-called “lockout period,” before which insiders were precluded from selling shares.

Scott Painter, TrueCar chief executive officer, expressed satisfaction that the company’s share price remained strong through the secondary offering.

“We were able to successfully manage that process in a way that resulted in not a dip, but a nice gradual appreciation, and to successfully allow the employees that wanted to get liquidity on the day of their lockups expiring, to give them flawless capability to do it,” he said.

TrueCar was founded in 2005 and has tweaked its business model several times during the past decade in order to comply with state laws and to avoid antagonizing dealers.

The $70 million the company raised in its IPO in May was relatively small, creating a public market for shares and greater disclosure of the company’s performance. The funds were used in part to pay for advertising, raising TrueCar’s profile and helping to attract customers to its website. Its latest financial report suggests the strategy is working: TrueCar posted third-quarter revenue of $57 million, up over 51% from a year earlier; users on TrueCar’s platform accounted for 172,000 sales in the period, up 47% from a year ago.

TrueCar’s analytic software, which relies on recent transaction prices gathered from dealers, allows shoppers to discover what it calls a “fair” price that is close to the transaction prices of similar or identical vehicles – almost in the way that securities prices are divulged. With this information, the shopper can arrange through TrueCar to buy such a vehicle at one of its 9,000 certified dealers. The dealer pays TrueCar $299 for each used-car transaction, $399 for each new-car sold.

Though TrueCar acts as an intermediary in the sale, it’s careful not to call itself a “broker,” a term that might bring it into conflict with laws in some states.

Some dealers identify themselves as anti-TrueCar because profit margins on new and used-car sales have been shrinking, in part due to more accurate disclosure of recent transactions. TrueCar argues that the same reporting can be helpful to dealers, too, helping them to avoid pricing mistakes when selling cars.

Another big change in automotive retailing could be unfolding with the announcement by AutoNation, the nation’s biggest publicly-owned chain of dealerships, that it next month will demonstrate a “digital storefront” that allows shoppers to inspect its inventory of cars, fill out paperwork and reserve a vehicle – all on line – on at a specified no-haggle price. The company said it has invested $100 million in the technology.

But many dealers insist that traditional customer visits to their showrooms and haggling sessions with their sales personnel won’t disappear anytime soon. They’re backing that opinion with sizable investments in stores that are bigger and glitzier than ever.",Online auto sales service had secondary offering last week.,"Generated Summary: The sense that automotive retailing is undergoing a sea change in the U.S. grows stronger, at least judging from the performance of TrueCar common stock."
237,"JPMorgan Chase has settled its portion in an antitrust lawsuit that alleged manipulation of foreign exchange benchmark rates, according to court filings.

The settlement terms for the largest U.S. bank were not disclosed in the letter filed in Manhattan court on Monday by the lawyers of the bank and the plaintiffs. A settlement agreement should be filed in court by the end of January.

JPMorgan stock was down 2.5 percent following the news.

In the consolidated antitrust lawsuit, several investors including hedge funds, the city of Philadelphia and public pension funds claimed that a dozen banks violated federal antitrust laws, conspiring since January 2003 to rig prices in the $5 trillion per day foreign exchange market. Defendants include including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Barclays, Deutsche, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

The lawsuit claimed traders from the banks used chat rooms, email and instant messaging to work together to rig rates.

238,"Foreclosure starts were up again in Massachusetts in October, jumping nearly 18 percent from the same month last year, according to new data from the Warren Group.

Lenders filed 1,135 foreclosure petitions in the state’s Land Court in October, compared with the 965 filed in October 2014, according to the Boston real estate publisher. Through the first 10 months of the year, lenders have filed 9,633 petitions, up more than 50 percent over the first 10 months of 2014. Not every petition results in a completed foreclosure.

Every county in Massachusetts has seen a substantial uptick in foreclosure petitions by lenders this year. While a greater number of petitions were filed in the densely-populated eastern areas of the state, Western Massachusetts has seen sharper increases. In hard-hit Hampshire County, for example, foreclosure petitions in towns like Northampton and Ware are up more than 100 percent year-over-year.

“It seems likely that the central and western counties are seeing more of an uptick than the eastern counties because of weaker economies in those regions,” said Warren Group chief executive Tim Warren Jr. “High paying jobs are less common and job growth is less robust. Lower home prices reflect that and probably the greater increase in foreclosure activity does too. The economic recovery is coming a little slower to Central and Western Massachusetts.”

Warren said the jump in foreclosures this year is due to lenders processing long-delinquent loans, which they had delayed acting on earlier because of legal uncertainty.

The pace of completed foreclosures slowed in October, Warren said. The company recorded 374 completed foreclosures during the month, down 11.6 percent from the same time period last year. For the year to date, completed foreclosures are up 19.4 percent, to 3,533.","The Warren Group said the jump in foreclosures this year is due to lenders processing long-delinquent loans, which they had delayed acting on earlier because of legal uncertainty.","Generated Summary: Foreclosure starts were up again in Massachusetts in October, jumping nearly 18 percent from the same month last year, according to new data from the same month last year, according to new data from the same month last year, according to new data from the Warren Group."

Some research has suggested that calcium, magnesium and fatty acids found dairy products may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, which develops when the body stops making insulin. So researchers from Harvard School of Public Health took a closer look at the possible relationship between yogurt consumption and diabetes, hypothesizing that yogurt’s probiotics and antioxidants may have a positive effect.

Researchers at looked at data from three cohorts of people who had their health and lifestyles followed. At the start of the studies, the participants filled out a questionnaire about their diets and history of chronic diseases. Every two years, researchers followed up with participants and updated the data.

The researchers did not find that dairy consumption in general affected diabetes risk, but they did find that yogurt was specifically associated with a lower risk of developing the disease. With further calculations, the researchers concluded that consuming one serving of yogurt per day was associated with an 18% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.

The researchers were not able to determine exactly what was providing the health benefit, and it’s likely that maintaining a healthy diet in general has a positive effect on type 2 diabetes risk, considering weight gain is one of the most prominent risk factors for the disease.

241,"The U.S. economy is faring better today than at any point since the Great Recession ended in the middle of 2009.

Jobs growth is strong and accelerating and the unemployment rate is below its historical average. The stock market remains near all-time highs, and the Federal Reserve appears confident enough in the economy’s strength to raise interest rates next week.

But before you bust out the noise makers, take a look at some of the 2016 economic outlooks from large investment banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan. Though economists at neither bank see the U.S. entering a recession soon, these reports underscore the fact that the current economic expansion is actually quite long by historical standards, and like all other expansions, will end at some point in a recession.

The Citi report, released last week, looks at data on the length of economic expansions in data from 1970-14 across U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan. “As the U.S. [economic expansion] enters year seven the cumulative probability of a recession in the next year rises to 65%,” writes Citi economists.

But there is reason to take this approach for a recession prediction with a grain of salt. While it’s true that today’s expansion is long in the tooth, there’s reason to believe that the relative weakness of the economic recovery will guarantee it’s longevity. That’s because recessions tend to occur when the economy overheats—producing more stuff than demand warrants. With inflation still low, and underemployment still high, most economists think we can bet on today’s expansion lasting significantly longer than others.

But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t start at least thinking about battening down the hatches. JPMorgan’s 2016 outlook predicts some stormy economic weather ahead, just not as soon as next year.

JPMorgan is putting a 76% chance of a recession within the next three years, with just a 25% of chance of a recession within the next 12 months. One of the main reasons the bank is bearish in the medium term is the trend in corporate profits. According to the report, over the past year corporate margins have fallen more than five percent, which isn’t good news. “On most (but not all) of the occasions when this variable fell to its current level, a recession began within a few years,” JPMorgan economists write. “Although continued expansion remains our baseline forecast, we will more carefully investigate the risks of recession emanating from the corporate sector.”

JPMorgan economists aren’t the first to worry about the state of corporate profits. We are now in the midst of a corporate profits recession, driven in part by weak commodity prices and slow economic growth abroad. At the same time, corporate margins have hit all-time highs in recent years, and analysts believe this is one reason for the slow growth in wages of late. If declining profit margins are the result of employers giving a larger piece of the economic pie to their workers, that could help boost consumer spending and therefore economic growth.

But falling margins could simply be a predictor of a tepid appetite for corporate investment, which has already been weak to begin with. The smart money is, for the time being, on continued economic growth for the next year or two. But given how old the current expansion is, it makes sense to keep one’s eyes peeled for recession signals.",They say we may be overdue.,Generated Summary: The U.S. economy is faring better today than at any point since the Great Recession ended in the middle of 2009.

The robot, FORPHEUS, measures 2.7 metres and spider-shaped with three legs. It's capable of judging the level of its opponent and adapting its game play.

""In order to promote mutual development between human and machine, the 2016 model uses sequential deep learning to assess an opponent's' level of skills as a rally unfolds, adapting returns to the ability of its human counterpart,"" said the company's developer Omron Corp in a statement.

FORPHEUS assesses the opponent's level as beginner, intermediate or advanced, and adapts its game play accordingly, allowing even inexperienced players to engage in long rallies, as could be seen at the CEATE technology fair in Chiba, southeast of Tokyo.

The machine's artificial intelligence allows it to adapt its parameters to make returns on the ping pong table with a precision of five centimetres, as compared to 10 centimetres in the previous version.

It also comes equipped with 3D technology to sight the ping pong ball.

During a game, the robot can also make faster returns at unpredictable angles, that helps to further sharpen the skills of already capable opponents, the company said.

246,"On April 15, 2013, Dr. Robert Ferrante, a medical researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, placed an overnight order for cyanide to be delivered to his lab. Paying with a corporate credit card, Ferrante was very specific in his request. ""He said he wanted the best and the purest,"" lab manager Michele Perpetua testified in court.

That much is uncontroverted. What's unclear is what Ferrante did after receiving the chemical.

Two days after Dr. Ferrante bought the cynaide, his wife, Dr. Autumn Klein, fell ill. She died three days later. Prosecution experts maintain that her symptoms were consistent with cyanide poisoning – and that she died at the hands of a husband who thought she was having an affair.

""All along, the evidence will show you that this defendant thinks he's smarter than everyone else,"" assistant district attorney Lisa Pelligrini said during opening statements. ""Mr. Ferrante was one blood test and one phone call from getting away with the perfect murder.""

But the defense claims that it wasn't a murder at all and that Dr. Klein's symptoms were inconsistent with cyanide poisoning.

""Myself and Dr. Ferrante do not accept – and will never accept – that Autumn Klein died from orally ingesting hydrogen cyanide,"" said defense attorney William Difenderfer in his opening statement. ""And they can't prove it.""

During opening arguments last week, prosecutors played the 911 call placed by Dr. Ferrante on April 17. During the call, Klein was heard gasping for breath in the background. ""Sweetheart. Sweetheart, I love you very much,"" Ferrante said to Klein as they waited for an ambulance. ""Please don't do it. Please.""

Prosecutor Lisa Pelligrini told the jury that Klein was ""gasping and groaning and moaning and dying"" during the call.

By most accounts, Ferrante and Klein had a happy marriage for several years, but things began to fall apart in 2012, when the couple began trying to have a second child. (They have a six-year-old daughter.) After some unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant, the stress was clearly showing in their relationship.

In an February 2013 email presented by the prosecution, Klein took her husband to task for being emotionally distant and uninterested in expanding their family. ""I realize now I have been alone in this entire emotional journey,"" she wrote. ""I can't even speak to you without getting angry."" A few days later, she wrote again. ""I have written you many letters that I have not sent,"" she wrote. ""I don't know where things are going to go, and you may not like what you hear, but I think it is about time we talked.""

But by April 2013, things had seemingly smoothed over. Ferrante and Klein were again trying to get pregnant. In court, prosecutors presented a text message exchange that they say showed Ferrante's attempt to poison his wife.

""I have an aura. According to my calendar I ovulate tomorrow,"" Dr. Klein texted her husband at 1:05 p.m. on April 17, 2013.

""Perfect timing. Creatine."" he responded, adding a smiling emoticon. ""It will make a huge difference. I am certain of it.""

About nine hours before Klein fell ill, she texted him again. ""Will it stimulate egg production, too?"" Ferrante responded with a smiling emoticon.

In court on Thursday, former lab worker Amanda Mihalik testified that she saw Ferrante with a Ziploc bag of creatine. ""He told me he intended to give it to his wife,"" she testified. She also claimed that she saw him mixing substances in a laboratory beaker. ""He seemed a bit different that week,"" she said. ""He was acting a little bizarre.""

When the defense began their presentation on Monday, they attacked the blood tests done on Klein. Dr. Robert Middleberg, a forensic toxicologist, was the defense's first expert witness. He testified that the toxicology results were ""equivocal,"" meaning they could neither prove or disprove that Klein was poisoned. The prosecution pointed out that he was being paid $5,000 to testify for the defense.

A second expert, Dr. Shaun Carstairs, testified that ""it cannot really be definitively stated that Dr. Klein died of cyanide poisoning.""

247,"President Barack Obama on Tuesday floated the idea of making it easier for student borrowers to get rid of some of their student debt through the bankruptcy process.

Thirteen Democrats in the Senate acted on that suggestion Thursday when they introduced a bill dubbed the Fairness for Struggling Students Act of 2015 that will treat student loans issued by private banks the same as other types of private unsecured debt in bankruptcy proceedings.

At the moment, it’s nearly impossible to wipe out student loans in personal bankruptcy; it’s only allowed in extremely rare circumstances. That’s thanks in part to a change in the federal bankruptcy code in 2005 that shielded private loans from being discharged in bankruptcy. A similar protection for government-issued or guaranteed loans had been in place since 1978. The bill introduced Thursday seeks to reverse those 2005 changes so borrowers can once again get rid of private loans in bankruptcy.

“Too many Americans are carrying around mortgage-sized student loan debt that forces them to put off major life decisions like buying a home or starting a family. We can no longer sit by while this student debt bomb keeps ticking,” Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois and a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.

To be clear, if the bill defies the long odds it faces in a Republican-controlled Congress and becomes law, it will cover only a small chunk of student loans. Private banks issue about 10% of all student loans and only those would be eligible for discharge in bankruptcy. The federal government issues the remaining 90% of student loans and they would remain relatively untouchable.

Even still, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau pegs total student loan debt at $1.2 trillion—more than the nationwide balances for credits cards and auto loans—or about $30,000 per student on average. Of that, $165 billion stems from private loans. Student loans made by banks are an obvious target for the Obama administration because they often lack the lower interest rates, consumer protections, and repayment options that accompany loans issued by the government. In 2012, at least 850,000 private student loans equaling $8 billion were in default, according to the CFPB.

The new bill is the latest in a series of efforts by the White House to address the nation’s ballooning student debt. The Obama administration is also planning to set up a system in which borrowers can lodge complaints against loan servicers. In June, it announced an expansion of a federal program aimed at lowering student loan payments.

The Consumer Bankers Association, the lending industry’s primary trade group, responded to Obama’s proposal to allow the elimination of private loans in bankruptcy by pointing out that less than 3% of private loan borrowers are in “financial distress.” It encouraged lawmakers to address the rising costs of college instead.","It may be a legislative long shot, but 13 Senators want some student borrowers to have a bankruptcy option for debt relief.",Generated Summary: President Barack Obama on Tuesday floated the idea of making it easier for student borrowers to get rid of some of their student debt through the bankruptcy process.

250,"A new study finds that people who are depressed and respond strongly to placebo treatments also reap the most benefit when they’re given real antidepressants.

The new paper, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looks at the unique relationship between placebo and depression treatment. Placebo effect accounts for anywhere from 30-45% of response to antidepressants, data shows. And even though antidepressants are the third most common prescription drug taken by Americans, there remains a lot medical experts do not understand about their function, or why they appear to work better in some people over others.

In the new trial, published Wednesday, the researchers focused on the mu-opioid system in the brain, colloquially referred to as the brain’s “painkiller system.” The researchers had 35 people with major depressive disorder take a new depression drug (which was actually a placebo) before taking drugs already proven to treat depression. The researchers found that the men and women who reported the greatest improvement in depression symptoms after taking placebo pills also showed the greatest mu-opioid system response in the brain, which was determined through brain scans.

These same people were also more likely to have better results when they took the real antidepressants. The response to the placebo pills predicted 43% of the variance in the response users had to the antidepressants.

That’s meaningful, say the researchers, because the vexing placebo factor in previous antidepressant research has led the field to stall somewhat, causing “the reduction or discontinuation of research on new treatments for depression and other neuropsychiatric illnesses,” the University of Michigan researchers write.

The researchers say their findings can help drug developers parse the effects people are getting from depression drugs versus a placebo effect. Understanding how well a person responds to placebo could also inform a treatment plan, according to the new paper.

“The findings show that the response to medications, in this case antidepressants in major depression, is a complex process that also engages internal mechanisms of resiliency as well as the potential effects of medications,” says study author Dr. Jon-Kar Zubieta, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Utah (formerly at Michigan).

“Examining the source of individual variations in the capacity to engage those resiliency mechanisms provides new targets for drug development to enhance those mechanisms. It may also suggest that some individuals may respond to enhancements in the treating environment, since that is thought to underlie the formation of placebo effects. For example, therapies or improved clinician-patient interactions.”

The study size is small, but the researchers argue that the findings suggest that some people are highly response to the intention of treating their depression.

If the findings hold true, treatments for depression could be enhanced if therapies—drug and non-drug—focused on encouraging a person’s natural resiliency. Exactly how to go about that will still need to be determined.",The findings could affect future depression treatments,Generated Summary: A new study finds that people who are depressed and respond strongly to placebo treatments also reap the most benefit when they’re given real antidepressants.
251,"NEW YORK -- Anne Jackson, a Tony Award-nominated theater actress who often appeared onstage with her husband, Eli Wallach, in comedies and classics, died early Tuesday of natural causes at her home in Manhattan, said her son, Peter Wallach. She was 90.

Jackson and Eli Wallach were a formidable acting duo, starring in a series of plays, including George Bernard Shaw's ""Major Barbara"" in 1956 and a hugely successful run of ""Luv,"" directed by Mike Nichols, in the mid-1960s. A bench in New York City's Riverside Park is dedicated to them.

""A lot of people say, 'Sorry for your loss,'"" said Peter Wallach. ""Actually, the part I don't accept is the loss part because it was a gift. My parents gave this tremendous gift, which they gave to the world and they gave to their children.""

Jackson and Wallach played a married couple together as recently as 2003 on the NBC medical drama ""ER."" At the 2010 American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Governors Award honoring Wallach, Jackson introduced her husband: ""Can I be honest about something?"" she asked. ""I taught him everything he knows.""

Jackson, who played a psychiatrist in the classic horror movie ""The Shining,"" earned a best featured actress Tony nomination in Paddy Chayefsky's ""Middle of the Night"" in 1956. She also returned to Broadway in the mid-1990s in ""The Flowering Peach"" and played Grandma Kurnitz in ""Lost in Yonkers.""

She and the Tony-winning Wallach acted together onstage in such plays as ""Cafe Crown,"" ''Harlequinade,"" ''The Typist and the Tiger,"" ''Twice Around the Park"" and ""Down the Garden Paths"" in 2000, among others.

The couple met when Wallach appeared in the 1946 Equity Library Theater's ""This Property is Condemned"" by Tennessee Williams. The only other performer in the show happened to be Jackson. They married in 1948. He died in 2014.

Peter Wallach, a film animator, recalled growing up in a happy home in which the children never really knew if their parents were actually arguing or if they were just rehearsing.

""Even sometimes when they'd fight, they would kind of step back from the fight and go, 'Wow, that was a really good Tennessee Williams performance I just gave!'"" he said. ""They always forgave each other so quickly because they were both actors.""

Jackson and Wallach loved New York and were friends with everyone from Harry Belafonte to Igor Stravinsky to Groucho Marx. Wallach rode the subway everywhere except for a time in 1997, while performing in ""Visiting Mr. Green"" off-Broadway. His wife stepped in and ordered producers to provide a Rolls-Royce to ferry Wallach to and from the show. ""She was a tough negotiator -- out of love,"" Peter Wallach said.

Though the couple also acted independently, Jackson told The Associated Press in 1989: ""We do have a lot of fun working together. We're both quite good character actors. The characterizations that we come up with make it seem like it's a different person we're relating to.""

When he acted without her, Wallach said he asked her advice. ""I just finished playing a judge in 'Law and Order.' I said, 'How do I play a judge?' She said, 'Bang the gavel hard and just say, ""Overruled!'""

The two wrote and performed a show about their lives that opened in 1993 at the off-Broadway Kaufman Theater. It gracefully weaved scenes from plays in which they acted together or separately with glimpses into their marriage and family life.

""They worked in theater, they worked in television, they worked in movies. They could move eloquently back and forth,"" said Peter Wallach, who noted his mother's comic chops. ""Her timing was just so magnificent. She was the queen of the one-liners.""

Jackson wrote a memoir, ""Early Stages,"" which traced her childhood and ended with the birth of Peter.

The late megastar's personal address book dates from the 1980s when his long career was a few decades away from his heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.

It reads like a who's who of superstardom and includes names and addresses of the likes of Oscar-winner Sidney Poitier, Michael Jackson and even tennis star Björn Borg.

Perhaps one of the most unusual names listed in the book is that of former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who allegedly had a relationship with Davis Jr's wife Altovise.

Los Angeles-based auction house Nate D Sanders is selling off the spiral-bound book filled out by the singer on Thursday and the minimum bid is $4,000.

Davis Jr. was famed for his association with singers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, collectively known as the Rat Pack, which at the height of their fame in the 1960s starred in several films, including the original “Ocean's Eleven.”

Davis, who was one of the first African-American superstars, shot to fame in 1951 after a performance that rocked Hollywood nightclub Ciro's after that year's Academy Awards.

253,"Melbourne-based writer and feminist Clementine Ford says readers should not expect her first book to be polite or palatable.

Ford, a weekly columnist for Fairfax Media's Daily Life, released her self-described ""manifesto"" Fight Like A Girl on Wednesday.

The autobiographical release includes stories of body image, sex and mental health, along with her journey from rejecting the feminist label as a teenager to wholly embracing it as an adult.

In the chapter Hate Male, Ford recounts the barrage of abuse she received via social media including one incident which led to a man being sacked by his employer, Meriton Apartments, in 2015.

""I think you have to agitate something if you want it to change, you can't just be polite to it,"" she told AAP.

""You can't change the surface area of a lake by looking at it, you have to throw a rock in it.""

Ford has more than 135,000 followers on Facebook, 55,000 on Twitter and 15,000 on Instagram.

She is renowned for publishing screenshots of the abuse and unsolicited images she receives on these accounts to name and shame users.

""I get a lot of emails from guys now that say my uncompromising approach has been more successful in changing their minds than previous methods,"" she said.

""I encourage women to speak back and to shout back and to not tolerate.""

Ford, who welcomed a baby with her partner Jesse in August, said the primary audience for her book is women who are already predisposed to her message but encouraged teenagers - both girls and boys - and men to read it.

""A lot of men like to pat themselves on the back for doing the right thing, and I make them feel uncomfortable because I say they're not doing enough,"" she said.

""There is more to being a good guy than just not being a bad guy. I'm challenging the notion of what equality looks like.

""Hopefully there will be people that have had it bought for them or perhaps they're dipping their toe in, and I hope that what it does is makes them feel galvanised but also makes them feel recognised.""

With the rise of people embracing the feminist label, the past few years have also seen a wave of people posting on social media with the hashtag #WomenAgainstFeminism.

""There are people now who do opt out of the feminist movement as a way to distinguish themselves,"" Ford said.

""It's interesting that movement has arisen and has a name, whereas previously that was just society.""

254,"A Brisbane mother has allegedly starved her baby almost to death and used the girl's plight to raise more than $15,000 though GoFundMe.

The 27-year-old, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is charged with torture, grievous bodily harm and fraud.

Her daughter, now aged 14 months, was in such a malnourished state when she was admitted to hospital in July that doctors did not expect her to survive.

She was hospitalised for a month and had to be fed through a drip, but has since gained 50 per cent in body weight.

It's alleged her mother, who has three older children, set up a fundraising site on GoFundMe using her baby's condition to raise more than $15,000.

She posted photos of her little girl lying in a hospital bed in February and said that the doctors could not figure out why her she was so malnourished.

""We haven't given up on hope, but it's the unknown and not knowing how long we will have her with us which is the hardest to deal with,"" she wrote.

""Words can't describe how greatful (sic) we are in the generosity everyone has shown in helping our family through this difficult time.""

The mother-of-four faced Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday and was granted bail to reappear on December 20.

She has denied any involvement in restricting her child's diet.

The woman, who describes herself as full-time stay at home parent, claims to have suffered from bulimia since she was a teenager, and has also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

She also claims the children's father was physically and mentally abusive towards her and that one of her other children was conceived when he sexually assaulted her.

The mother's abuse was apparently only towards her youngest child and she is said to care very well for her other children, aged six, five and three.

In a letter to the court her doctor said she now wants to have more contact with her baby to try and bond with her.

The toddler's speech and motor skills have been impaired, and she could suffer from lifelong problems as a result of the abuse.

255,"The solar panels that Idaho inventor Scott Brusaw has built aren't meant for rooftops.

They are meant for roads, driveways, parking lots, bike trails and, eventually, highways.

Brusaw, an electrical engineer, says the hexagon-shaped panels can withstand the wear and tear that comes from inclement weather and vehicles, big and small, to generate electricity.

""We need to rebuild our infrastructure,"" said Brusaw, the head of Solar Roadways, based in Sandpoint, Idaho, northeast of Spokane, Washington. His idea contains ""something for everyone to like.""

""Environmentalists like it,"" he said. ""Climate change deniers like it because it creates jobs.""

While the idea may sound outlandish to some, it has already got $US850,000 ($A919,665) in seed money from the US federal government, raised more than $US2 million on a crowd-funding website and received celebrity praise.

Solar Roadways is part of a larger movement that seeks to integrate renewable energy technology - including wind, geothermal and hydro power - seamlessly into society.

The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group based in Washington, DC, described companies like Solar Roadways as ""niche markets"" in the booming alternative energy industry.

""They represent the type of creative innovation that addresses design and energy, while showcasing the diversity of solar applications,"" said Tom Kimbis, a vice president of the association.

Brusaw said that in addition to producing energy, the solar panels can melt away snow and ice, and display warning messages or traffic lines with LED lights.

There are sceptics, who wonder about the durability of the panels, which are covered by knobby, tempered glass, and how they would perform in severe weather or were covered with dirt.

""It seems like something reasonable and something that is going to be very expensive,"" said Lamar Evans of the National Renewable Energy Association in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

Another problem would be how to store the electricity that could be generated, Evans said.

The Brusaws have produced no estimates of how much the solar panels would cost, so the financial realities of their vision remain an unknown.

To demonstrate the concept, the company has created a small parking lot at its headquarters, using 108 solar panels. Vehicles have been driven onto the space, without damaging the panels, he said.

""We'll start off small with driveways and walkways,"" he said.

His wife Julie came up with the idea after watching An Inconvenient Truth, the global warming movie featuring former US Vice President Al Gore, Brusaw said.

She remembered that Scott had long talked about the concept of electric roads.

The US Federal Highway Administration gave the Brusaws $US850,000 to develop Solar Roadways over the past few years, and build the prototype parking lot.

This year, they turned to the Indiegogo crowd-funding site to raise additional money and move to the next phase. Launched on Earth Day, the campaign got off to a discouraging start, Brusaw said.

Donations trickled in slowly, but two factors helped spread the company's vision: a viral YouTube video and celebrity mentions in social media. The video has more than 14 million views.

The floodgates opened when actor George Takei of Star Trek fame and the TV show MythBusters both mentioned the company. They received donations from more than 45,000 people in 50 countries.

The money will enable the company to hire staff and begin production of more panels, Brusaw said.

""Once we've perfected everything, our ultimate goal will be highways,"" he said.

256,"lan Morison, right, Australian editor of the website Phuketwan and his colleague Chutima Sidasathien speak to the media. (AAP)

An Australian journalist, cleared this month by a Thai court of criminal defamation charges brought by the Royal Thai Navy, says he feels ""vindicated"" after the navy said it would not appeal the verdict.

Alan Morison, 67, originally from Melbourne and editor of online news service Phuketwan, was told on Tuesday the Thai navy would no longer pursue the case.

He and Thai reporter Chutima Sidasathian were found not guilty by Phuket Criminal Court on September 1.

The charges related to Phuketwan's 2013 republishing of excerpts from a Reuters' newsagency story alleging Thai security forces were involved in the trafficking of persecuted Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar.

Morison said the navy's decision not to appeal made sense following news of a further 32 police and immigration officers being transferred for their involvement in the trafficking.

Earlier, more than 50 people, including several local politicians and officials, were arrested on charges of human trafficking, detention and ransom.

A provincial court had also recently issued arrest warrants for four senior military officers, including a naval commander.

""[The navy] is not going to appeal, which would make sense in view of what's happened to the commander and the colonels in the army, but we expect to see further action on the human trafficking front as well,"" Morison told AAP.

But Morison says he will walk away from the online news service he set up in 2008.

""We hope Phuketwan will continue, but we're not likely to be involved,"" he said.

The news service was ""for sale"", but he doubted there were many people ""brave enough"" to enter the media these days.

He said he felt vindicated given subsequent reporting on the Rohingya boat people and official collusion on trafficking.

""I guess we derive a great deal of self satisfaction from being proved right, even if it has cost us quite a bit to be true to that,"" he said.

Hinckley, who was declared not guilty of the attempted assassination on grounds of insanity, said after shooting the president outside a Washington hotel that he wanted to kill Reagan to impress the actor Jodie Foster, with whom he became obsessed after viewing the film ""Taxi Driver.""

The court order places dozens of detailed conditions on Hinckley's ""full-time convalescent leave"" from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington.

John Hinkley after his arrest for the attempted assassination. (AFP)

They include a ban on contact with survivors and Foster, but could be phased out after a year to 18 months if he continues to make progress.

US District Judge Paul Friedman wrote that Hinckley, 61, no longer poses a threat to himself or others.

He will be freed as soon as August 5 to live with his 90-year-old mother in her gated community in Williamsburg, Virginia.

""Contrary to the judge's decision, we believe John Hinckley is still a threat to others and we strongly oppose his release,"" the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said in a statement.

The attack badly wounded three other men, including Reagan press secretary James Brady.

Following a two-month trial in 1982, a federal jury found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity. The widely criticised verdict led many states to tighten the laws on insanity defenses.

Since the 1990s, Hinckley has been permitted gradually longer supervised home visits with his mother, lately lasting up to 17 days and always tracked by Secret Service agents.

Members of Reagan's family have consistently opposed Hinckley's release.

Daughter Patti Reagan Davis wrote on her website in 2015, ""I hope the doctors are right when they say that John Hinckley isn't a danger to anyone, but something in me feels they are wrong.""

The dramatic scene immediately after the shooting. (AFP)

One thing troubling her, she said, was that while at St. Elizabeths, Hinckley had written to the mass murderers Ted Bundy and Charles Manson.

But Hinckley attorney Barry Levine has argued since 2003 that evaluations by the hospital's officials showed that he no longer posed any threat.

The attempt on Reagan's life sparked intense debate over gun violence and the treatment of the mentally ill. Brady, though left paralysed, became a leading gun-control advocate.

A medical examiner attributed Brady's death in 2014 to the injuries received 33 years earlier, but no additional charges were filed against Hinckley.

The 1981 attack also badly wounded US Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy and local police officer Thomas Delahanty.

Hinckley must remain within 50 miles of his mother's home, and cannot travel to any area where a current or former president, vice president or member of Congress is known to be.

He must return to St. Elizabeths for monthly monitoring and must notify the Secret Service in advance about his intended route of travel.

James Brady, lying on the ground in this shot, was wounded in the assassination attempt. (AP)

He cannot post any writings or memorabilia on the internet or display them in person without authorisation.

The detailed conditions even include a requirement for monthly music therapy sessions with a board-certified music therapist.

St. Elizabeths, Hinckley's home for most of the past 35 years, opened in 1855, the first federally run psychiatric hospital.

Though it once housed as many as 8,000 patients - many of them indigent - the aging facility is being phased out and now holds only a few hundred.

But it defended Monday night's program as excellent journalism, which shared stories that needed to be told.

The government of Nauru on Tuesday claimed the ABC did not seek comment before airing the ""wild and unsubstantiated"" claims by ""discredited"" former detention welfare services provider Save the Children.

""It was clear that these children were coached, and that the entire process of filming the refugees was stage-managed, as the program has not been to Nauru,"" the government said in a statement.

The government accused the ABC of biased political propaganda, saying the report was an embarrassment to journalism.

""From start to finish it was denigrating, racist, false and pure political activism,"" it said.

Editorial director Alan Sunderland confirmed to a Senate estimates hearing the show did not request comment from the Nauru government.

""On this particular story I don't believe we did and I believe that's because we felt the issues the story raised were particularly relevant to the Australian government, which of course we did approach"" he said.

263,"India used to be one of the most expensive countries in the world to buy an Apple iPhone. Not anymore.

The price of the iPhone 5s, the least expensive iPhone model Apple currently sells, has dropped to Rs 24,999 ($370) in India, The Economic Times reported Monday. As recently as September, it cost Rs 44,500 ($665), representing a 43% drop in price. Apple sells the iPhone 5s for $450 without a contract in the United States.

The price cut is the third drop for the phone in India in the past three months, according to the report. Apple doesn’t run physical or online Apple stores in India. The recent iPhone price drops were spotted on authorized online resellers Flipkart and Infibeam.

The iPhone 5s is the best-selling iPhone in India, accounting for almost half of iPhone sales in the country. However, Apple AAPL isn’t a major player in India, accounting for only 1% of market share, according to market researcher Counterpoint Research. That’s mostly due to price—the iPhone 5s is still several times more expensive than entry-level phones. Phones that cost less than $100 account for nearly half of all smartphones sold in India.

Still, Apple sold 1.7 million phones in India in its most recent fiscal year. Analysts believe there is only so much market share that Apple can capture if it continues to offer only premium phones in India.

India is poised to become one of the next major smartphone battlegrounds, as most consumers in the United States and Europe already have smartphones, slowing the upgrade cycle, and the previous big growth market, China, is showing signs of saturation as well. Market researcher IDC predicts India will be a bigger smartphone market than the U.S. by 2017.

The iPhone 5s is now firmly priced in India’s “midtier” price range, with devices costing more than $250 but less than $400. Apple rival Samsung, which leads the India market with 23.2% of device sales, is focusing its recent efforts in the same price range. However, Samsung SSNLF manufactures many of its devices in India, unlike Apple, which allows it to bypass high import taxes.

Apple’s pricing experiment raises questions about the possibility of a lower-cost, 4-inch iPhone launching next year. The iPhone 5s is the last remaining iPhone with a 4-inch screen, and analysts who study Apple’s Asian supply chain believe that the company could make an updated version next year with upgraded features like Apple Pay, its mobile wallet, that retails for between $400 and $500.

If the iPhone 5s is Apple’s product of choice to establish itself in India, then it would make a lot of sense for the company to update it next year, instead of sending it off into the sunset. Alternatively, the price drops could be a sign that Indian retailers are clearing out old stock to make way for a new midpriced iPhone.

264,"Etsy wants to put an end to maternity leave.

Instead, the online marketplace is pushing parental leave—a policy that doesn’t discriminate between moms and dads. On Tuesday, the company announced a new policy that will provide 26 weeks of paid leave that employees can use within two years of becoming a parent, regardless of their gender.

“We want to support and enable parents, regardless of their gender, to play equal roles in building successful companies and nurturing their families,” writes Juliet Gorman, Etsy’s director of culture and engagement in a blog post. The post also notes that Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson took five weeks of paternity leave after he and his wife adopted their son nearly four years ago. That was the full extent of what Etsy offered fathers at the time.

The company also published a Medium post that lays out the value of gender-neutral policies. A few key takeaways:

So-called “traditional” family structures are receding. The percentage of two-parent, single-earner households has fallen from 45% in 1975 to around 20% today.

Giving dads leave has been proven to making parenting more equitable. In Iceland, where nearly 80% of fathers take leave, studies have shown that in some cohorts, 70% of their parents share care equally.

Paternity leave is good for moms’ health. Having a spouse who did not take any leave after childbirth is associated with higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms.

While Etsy should be commended for its new policy—and for stressing the importance of treating moms and dads equally, it is not the first company to offer gender-neutral leave.

Equity incentive awards now comprise 70% or more of total summary CEO pay in the United States, according to MSCI, which examined 800 CEOs at 429 large and midsize companies in the United States from 2006 to 2015. If that pay was actually effective in incentivizing superior future performance, one would expect a strong correlation between higher pay figures and total shareholder return. MSCI’s analysis suggests the opposite:

[W]e found little evidence to show a link between the large proportion of pay that such awards represent and long-term company stock performance. In fact, even after adjusting for company size and sector, companies with lower total summary CEO pay levels more consistently displayed higher long-term investment returns.

One-hundred dollars invested in the 20% of corporations with the top-paid CEOs would have grown to $265 over the study’s 10-year window. Meanwhile, $100 invested in the companies overseen by the lowest-paid CEOs would have increased to $367.

MSCI blames this misalignment, in part, on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s disclosure rules that focus on annual reporting instead of long-term results. It suggests that a CEO’s cumulative pay and performance data over his or her entire tenure should also be taken into account to reduce reliance on figures that only consider the short-term.",A new study sheds fresh light on the correlation between CEO pay and total shareholder return.,Generated Summary: Critics of exorbitant CEO pay got some new ammo Monday.
266,"It’s getting harder to tell whether Russia’s preparations for hosting the soccer World Cup in 2018 are in bigger trouble on the field or off it.

On Monday, the government slashed the equivalent of over half a billion dollars from its budget for the tournament, trying to make sure that the ruble’s devaluation doesn’t end up driving the final bill higher. Russia’s budget is under severe pressure from the sharp fall in oil prices and western sanctions over its behavior toward neighboring Ukraine. The European Union renewed its sanctions for another six months Monday.

But at least today the country has solved one problem: the humungous wage bill of its Italian coach, Fabio Capello. Capello said last week he hadn’t been paid for eight months – a reflection of the troubles that the Russian Football Union (RFS) has had in trying to deliver the 2018 tournament.

The situation was rescued Tuesday by billionaire businessman Alisher Usmanov, who owns a minority stake in the London-based club Arsenal FC. Sky Sports reported his press service as saying that Usmanov had donated 300 million rubles ($5.5 million) to pay off the arrears. The heavily-indebted RFS’s own boss Nikolay Tolstykh was sacked three weeks ago.

Whether saving Capello will get Usmanov any plaudits at home is another question. The veteran coach, who has led AC Milan and the Italian and English national teams, is presiding over a wretched run of results since crashing out of last year’s World Cup in Brazil in the group stages, behind Algeria.

The team’s latest embarrassment, a 1-0 loss at the hands of little Austria, left Russia on the verge of missing out entirely on the European Championships next year and caused fans to launch a nationwide crowd-funding campaign to get rid of him.

But if the Capello problem (or at least its financial aspects) is now solved, the off-field issues remain a headache. Russia’s bid for the rights to host the 2018 World Cup is the subject of two criminal investigations in the U.S. and Switzerland that focus on allegations that bribes were paid to win the rights to host the tournaments.

President Vladimir Putin, who personally backed the campaign to host the 2018 tournament, stressed at the weekend that: “We won in a free fight and we are going to host the World Cup.”

Initially, the 2018 campaign was an echo of the “money-no-object” approach that went into preparing the Sochi Winter Olympics. Those games ended up being the most expensive games in history, costing over $51 billion and drawing allegations of widespread corruption and cronyism.

In the new economic reality, Russia is now scaling back its designs, trimming the capacity of the planned new stadia and, with yesterday’s plans, striking some hotels entirely. The campaign originally promised six new stadiums and new training grounds and health facilities to cater for the players, as well as major upgrades to air and rail links for the fans.

The government initially estimated a total cost of around 664 billion rubles for the tournament–around $22 billion at the exchange rates that prevailed then. The latest revision brings it to 631 billion, but the dollar budget is much lower, because the ruble lost over a third of its value against the dollar since then.

The new costings suggest the World Cup will cost less than a quarter of the final bill for Sochi. But cost overruns are again everywhere, not least due to higher bills for imported materials.

Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said recently the federal government will only cover 355 billion rubles of the total, meaning that Usmanov and others (particularly the oligarchs that own the clubs who will play at the new stadiums) may well end up dipping into their pockets again before the finals.

But what if you built it and they still didn’t come? Other national soccer associations have already started to murmur that they will force a new vote on hosting the 2018/2022 tournaments if the allegations of corruption are proved. Meanwhile, the contractor for one of the new stadiums, in Kaliningrad, has already gone bust.

And, as ever, the PR risks rival the business ones. Even if the tournament goes ahead, it will come hot on the heels of presidential elections in March that already looked pre-programmed to cause further trouble between Russia and the West. Putin is widely expected to run for a fourth term. His re-election in 2012 triggered large-scale demonstrations in Moscow after widespread allegations of ballot-rigging.

A repeat of that would hardly be the desired backdrop for his next prestige project. But at least the country will finally have the soccer infrastructure that a country with its rich sporting heritage deserves.

Mr Tromp was reported missing last week and found in Wangaratta on Saturday after he, his wife and three adult children left their Melbourne home on August 29 in bizarre circumstances and drove to NSW.

""Without reservation, I apologise for the hurt and concern caused by these events,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday.

The family will all be reunited soon and hopefully begin to make sense of their ""ordeal"", Mr Tromp said.

He asked for privacy as he and his family ""recover and receive appropriate assistance, including mental health services"".

Mr Tromp expressed ""deep gratitude"" to police and health care professionals and acknowledged ""the burden"" on community resources caused by last week's events.

There is still no explanation why the Tromp family abandoned their Silvan home last Monday and headed to NSW, panicked and with no apparent destination in mind.

The three adult children left their parents, Mark and Jacoba, a day later.

Mitchell, 25, went first, getting out in Bathurst, and making his way back to Victoria.

The others headed to Jenolan Caves, 150km west of Sydney, where Ella, 22, and Riana, 29, left their parents and headed to Goulburn.

There the sisters split up.

Ella went back to Melbourne to feed her horses.

Riana was found ""catatonic"" in the back of a ute and taken to Goulburn Hospital and police were called.

Police found the family home unlocked with phones and credit cards left behind.

Father-of-one Murat Kaya, 25, will remain behind bars until at least 2018 for allegedly helping to purchase the boat, car and trailer for the so-called ""terror tinnie plot"".

Kaya is one of six co-accused - along with self-styled Islamic cleric Robert ""Musa"" Cerantonio - police say were part of a plan to sail from Cape York to the Philippines to join Islamic State sympathisers.

During Kaya's bail application, the Victorian Supreme Court heard Cerantonio had previously ""expressed a desire to bring back the light of Islam to the Philippines"".

Cerantonio is also alleged to have spoken of his links with people in the Philippines who also have engaged in conduct promoting IS.

A photograph of Kaya, Cerantonio and others posing with a black IS flag in Footscray Park in July 2015 was tendered as part of the Crown's submissions opposing Kaya's bail application.

Kaya was arrested in Melbourne on May 27 and charged with making preparations for incursions into foreign countries to engage in hostile activities.

His five co-accused - Cerantonio, Paul Dacre, Shayden Thorne, Kadir Kaya and Antonio Granata - were arrested towing a boat near Cairns.

The Crown conceded in May there was no evidence Kaya intended to join the men overseas.

He is alleged to have travelled to Darwin on February 19 with a co-accused intending to buy a boat.

Police, who were monitoring Kaya at the time, say during the journey he described with ""jocularity"" performing ""certain seriously violent acts on others"".

The boat was not purchased in Darwin and on May 10 Kaya and Cerantonio were in Bendigo where they negotiated the price of a seven-metre boat, police say.

According to court documents, Cerantonio had come to the attention of authorities due to his high profile and ""extreme ideological support for an Islamic Caliphate"".

He has previously made public statements ""promoting, as a religious war, the establishment of an Islamic State"", the documents say.

Defence barrister Michael Tovey QC submitted there was no evidence Kaya had intended to join the other men overseas.

Detective Senior Constable Adam Foley conceded this was the case.

Justice James Elliott on Wednesday refused bail saying Kaya's circumstances were not exceptional given the charge he faces.

269,"It's not only the schools: Some doctors are taking issue with Flamin' Hot Cheetos because they are leading to unnecessary emergency room visits.

Several school districts in New Mexico, California and Illinois have made the move to ban the snacks from their campuses because they lack nutritional value, and research suggests the snacks may create a brain response similar to what is seen in individuals who are addicted to illicit substances. But, medical professionals are saying there's other health fears associated with the snack that are leading to doctor's visits.

Because the spicy snack contains a lot of red food dye, it can turn the stools of people who eat large quantities red or orange. Parents and kids may mistakenly assume that it is a sign of blood in the stool, leading to panicked trip to the hospital.

The good news is that nothing is probably wrong, according to experts.

""Food such as beets or red peppers can make stool appear red, however it is not actually blood in the stool,"" Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency medicine physician for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, told CBSNews.com.

Other foods with dyes that have also been reported to cause red stool include the dye found in red velvet cake.

But, St. Louis Children's Hospital pediatrician Dr. Kathleen Berchelmann pointed out to CBS station KMOX-TV in St. Louis, Mo. that you have to eat quite a bit of the red snack to see red in your stool. It may be it may be a sign of another health risk -- over-eating.

""So even though we might eat some foods with red food dye in them regularly, our stool doesn't usually become discolored unless you eat huge amounts of it,"" Berchelmann said. ""Flamin' Hot Cheetos is one food that people will eat enormous amounts of and will see a change in their stool.""

Glatter said that active bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract -- which includes the esophagus, stomach, duodenum and the first portion of the small bowel -- actually leads to stool that is black in color. Bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract, which includes the most of the small intestine, tends to be bright red or maroon in color.

To confirm if you are bleeding, doctors will run a fecal occult blood test. There are some other foods that can cause a false positive for blood in stool, including red meat, melons, (including cantaloupe), figs, horseradish, cauliflower, turnips and radishes so if you have been eating a lot of these items be sure to tell your doctor.

But red stool isn't the only problem that is sending kids who eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos to the ER.

""A number of patients who have consumed these Cheetos in excess have complained of pain in their upper abdomen, rising up into their chest, likely due to due to the red peppers and spice contained in the snack,"" Glatter said.

He warned that people with a history of GERD or gastroesophageal reflux -- which may cause heartburn and acid reflux -- should avoid the spicy treat because it can lead to a flare-up of their conditions.","Large amounts of Flamin' Hot Cheetos can cause heartburn or turn stool red, leading some to fear they are bleeding",Generated Summary: It's not only the schools: Some doctors are taking issue with Flamin' Hot Cheetos because they are leading to unnecessary emergency room visits.

In 2010, Elkis Hermida, a math teacher at Thomas Edison Middle School in L.A., began a six-month sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student.

He was convicted of lewd acts with a child and sentenced in July 2011 to three years in prison, according to

, which first reported the story this week.

The girl and her family then filed

against L.A. Unified, stating that the school district was negligent in both the hiring of Hermida and the supervision of a student.

However, once the case came to trial in November of last year, lawyers for the school district argued that not only did the school have no knowledge of the relationship, but also that the girl had consensual sex with Hermida and that she should be held accountable for it.

""She lied to her mother so she could have sex with her teacher,"" W. Keith Wyatt, L.A. Unified's trial attorney in the case, told KPCC.

He added: ""She went to a motel in which she engaged in voluntary consensual sex with her teacher. Why shouldn't she be responsible for that?""

The judge agreed and L.A. Unified was cleared of any wrongdoing.

The school district is now under fire for its handling of this case and others like it. California is one of a number of states where the age of consent laws conflict with the civil laws, allowing for a child to be found a victim in one case and at fault in another.

""It doesnât make sense,"" Jennifer Drobac, a law professor at Indiana University, told KPCC. ""The same parties, same behavior, same everything, consent is no defense in a criminal trial.

""But the same set of facts in a civil prosecution, consent is a complete defense. How is that possible? It's not logical,"" she concluded.

Attorney John Manly, who is representing families in a separate case against the district, added to the

: ""The belief that middle school children can consent to sexual activity is something one would expect to hear from pedophile advocates, not the second-largest school district in the U.S.""

Wyatt, however, maintains that a 14-year-old girl is completely capable of consenting to sex.

""Making a decision as to whether or not to cross the street when traffic is coming, that takes a level of maturity and that's a much more dangerous decision than to decide, 'Hey, I want to have sex with my teacher,' "" he told the radio station.

Wyatt has since apologized for his remarks, issuing a statement on Thursday.

""Upon reflection, I realize how insensitive the comments I made to KPCC were, and I am truly sorry to this young woman and her family,"" he wrote.

""My statements were ill thought out and poorly articulated and by no means reflect the opinions of the school district or its leadership. It is regrettable that my remarks have taken away from the respectful manner in which this case was tried.""

272,"A new Rembrandt painting has been unveiled, which is no mean feat given that he’s been dead since 1669.

This painting, however, was not created by the old master himself. Rather, it is the result of a project called The Next Rembrandt, sponsored by ING ing and Microsoft msft . It was “painted” by a 3D printer and essentially designed by algorithms.

Researchers from the Delft University of Technology, together with the curators of the Dutch museums Mauritshuis and Rembrandthuis, started by using 3D scanners and deep-learning algorithms to study Rembrandt van Rijn’s real paintings. This allowed them to compile a detailed database of his paintings’ typical features.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

They then chose to paint a typical Rembrandt subject: a 30- to 40-year-old Caucasian male with facial hair, in dark clothing, with a collar and a hat, facing right. With those specifications, they were able to generate features—eyes, nose, and so on—as Rembrandt might have done.

After that, an algorithm used data from Rembrandt’s paintings to determine the most appropriate proportions of and distances between the features, and the 3D printer produced the finished product using a paint-based ink in many layers to create an authentic texture.

The Next Rembrandt doesn’t copy any parts of real Rembrandt artwork, but it still does not represent true creativity. The painting may be an original work, but every element of it is based upon Rembrandt’s earlier, authentic pieces. The whole point is to simulate his work.

Indeed, creativity is a notable “Achilles’ heel” of artificial intelligence, which still lacks the ability to be truly novel in a deliberate way.

For more on artificial intelligence, watch:

Google’s Deep Dream algorithms arguably come closer to actual creativity, spinning wild, psychedelic interpretations out of random parts of pictures. However, while Deep Dream’s results can be interesting and sometimes hilarious, there is still no purpose behind them.

But while true artificial creativity still lies somewhere over the horizon, it’s certainly impressive to see how well algorithms can fake it these days.

273,"A Victorian minister who used his taxpayer-funded car to chauffeur his dogs while he was at work couldn't say how many times the ""mistake"" happened.

Corrections Minister Steve Herbert's dogs Patch and Ted were ferried more than 120 kilometres between his homes in Melbourne and country Victoria.

He told reporters the dog-only trips happened ""a couple of times"".

But he earlier told the Herald Sun newspaper he had ""not the foggiest"" idea how many times it had happened.

And the corrections minister didn't answer direct questions later in parliament, where pet dogs are not allowed.

""I made a mistake in trying to look after the dogs because of problems I had with my timetabling, my schedule,"" the Labor minister told reporters on Thursday.

""Being a minister in the senior portfolios, it's a tough job, it's a really tough job.

""And sometimes you make mistakes and this was one of them.""

Mr Herbert said he had ""needed to do something about the dogs"" because his job had played ""havoc"" with his domestic arrangements.

""I couldn't leave them and I had few options,"" he said, without giving details.

The dogs were ferried between Mr Herbert's homes in Parkdale in Melbourne's southeast and Trentham, 120 northwest, while he was at work.

Mr Herbert, who is paid at least $280,000 a year, says he has now made other ""domestic arrangements"" for the care of Patch and Ted.

He did not give details.

It's been reported Mr Herbert's former driver has lodged a complaint against him but the minister denies raising his voice against her.

""It's always difficult with drivers, we're in the car long times with them, I only wish (her) the best,"" he said.

Opposition leader Matthew Guy argued Mr Herbert's apology wasn't good enough.

""This minister should go. This minister has been caught out rorting the system,"" Mr Guy told reporters.

But Premier Daniel Andrews stood by Mr Herbert while acknowledging he did the wrong thing.

""The minister's been very clear about that - he's apologised for it,"" the premier told ABC radio.

""He's indicated that he's going to change his behaviour and that he won't be doing it again.""

Mr Herbert insisted there'd been no rorting and he was happy to repay the cost of the petrol used to ferry the pooches from Parkdale to Trentham.

Mr Andrews later backed Mr Herbert during a rowdy Question Time, rejecting calls for him to be sacked.

The premier told parliament the minister's driver had not lodged a complaint.

274,"Individual investors have more investment options than they often realize: namely stock options. Options allow you to make money whether the stock market is going up, down or sideways because, just as the name suggests, options give you the option to buy or sell a security (stocks, exchange-traded funds, indices, commodities, etc.) at some point in the future.

To understand why the value of calls and puts fluctuate when the market moves up and down, you need to understand what each type of option gives you the right to do once you have purchased it.

A call option gives you the right to buy a stock from the investor who sold you the call option at a specific price on or before a specified date. For instance, if you bought a 35 October call option on General Electric (nyse: GE - news - people ), the option would come with terms telling you that you could buy the stock for $35 (the strike price) any time before the third Friday in October (the expiration date). What this means is, if GE rises anywhere above $35 before the third Friday in October, you can buy the stock for less than its market value. Or if you don't want to buy the stock yourself or exercise the option, you can sell your option to someone else for a profit.

The drawback is if GE never rises above $35, your option won't be worth anything because nobody wants to buy an option that allows them to buy a stock for a higher price than they could get it for if they just went out into the open market and bought it.

A put option gives you the right to sell a stock to the investor who sold you the put option at a specific price, on or before a specified date. For instance, if you bought a 25 October put option on Pfizer (nyse: PFE - news - people ), the option would come with terms telling you that you could sell the stock for $25 (the strike price) any time before the third Friday in October (the expiration date). What this means is, if Pfizer falls anywhere below $25 before the third Friday in October, you can sell the stock for more than its market value. And if you don't want to sell the stock yourself, you can sell your option to someone else for a profit.

Now, you have to keep in mind that to make money you will not have purchased a put option on a stock that you own (although this can be a legitimate hedging strategy). If you owned the stock, the gains you would make on the put option would be offset by the losses you would incur on the stock. Instead, you would buy a put on a stock you don't own and then buy that stock right before you are ready to exercise the put. For instance, if you have purchased a put on Pfizer with a strike price of $25, and the stock dropped to $20, you could go out into the open market, buy the stock for $20 and turn around and sell it for $25, making a $5 profit.

The tricky part about options is that they expire. If you don't sell or exercise your option before the expiration date, you will lose your entire investment. That's a scary proposition, so you need to take care to always watch your expiration dates.

Options are no longer just for large institutional investors. You too can take advantage of the flexibility and leverage these wonderful trading tools offer.

275,"Apple has amended its policies for water-damaged iPods, according to new service documentation.

The French website igeneration.fr published an image provided by an Apple Authorized Service Provider that highlights a more lenient approach to dealing with water-damaged devices.

Apple devices, like the iPhone, iPod touch, iPod nano and iPod shuffle, have a liquid contact indicator (LCI) at the bottom of the headphone jack. The sensor changes color — from white/silver to red or pink — if it comes in contact with water.

When inspecting non-functional phones or iPod units, Apple repair specialists can use a magnifying flashlight to peer into the port to see if the sensor has changed color. These sensors are not supposed to be activated by changes in temperature or humidity. In the past, Apple’s official policy stated that without manager intervention, if a device indicates it has come into contact with water, repairs aren’t covered under warranty. This policy had triggered criticism because of the alleged sensitivity of these sensors. In 2009, news reports indicated that perspiration from the gym (or even sweaty palms) could trigger the LCI.

In December 2010, a 13-year-old Korean girl sued Apple after the company refused to repair her iPhone 3G, claiming it had come into contact with water, which she denied had happened. Rather than settle with Apple, the family decided to take the matter to court. The plaintiff’s father said they hoped “Apple [would] improve its service policy so that people facing similar situations can get back unjustly paid repair expenses.”

The lawsuit just might have paid off. Apple’s new policy states that customers who deny that their devices came into contact with water (and whose devices do not show external evidence of water damage or corrosion) may still be eligible for warranty service.

We like this policy change and wish that other electronics makers would consider adopting something similar.

Its Series D funding round, led by Sapphire Ventures, also includes existing investors Foundation Capital and Polaris Partners. The new infusion almost doubles the 200-person Boston company’s backing, bringing total backing to $60 million.

“App marketing is seeing tremendous growth, and Localytics has the strongest customers base and the unique combination of app marketing and analytics needed to dominate this category,” said Sapphire managing director Doug Higgins, who has joined Localytics’ board.

The company’s technology supports more than 32,000 apps across 2.3 billion devices, including software for Nordstrom, Rue La La, eBay, The Weather Channel, and MyFitness Pal. Many of the founders actually were mobile app developers before founding Localytics. CEO Raj Aggarwal, a former consultant with Bain & Co., was involved with the strategy behind the iPhone App Store concept. CTO Henry Cipolla built the analytics technology for Microsoft’s desktop applications.

“We set off to build a mobile analytics company, that could tell mobile apps developers what they could do to create a better experience,” Aggarwal said. “What we started to discover in working with customers is that they were struggling with monetization.”

The funds will be used to build out Localytics’ vision for “predictive app marketing” that goes beyond the in-app messages and push marketing used to encourage certain behaviors.

According to Localytics research, 20% of all mobile apps are used just once. If someone doesn’t return within the first week, there’s a 60% probability that he or she will never come back. Predictive app marketing will help marketers decide which users are at risk and which ones are worth pursuing.

“Predicting a user’s next move really brings personalization to life,” Aggarwal wrote in the company’s blog. “Our platform now takes the robust user and behavioral insights we collect for customers and users data science and machine learning to identify correlations and therefore a customer’s intent.”

280,"Traditionally speaking, corporate finance teams haven’t been quick to embrace cloud software for their day-to-day duties.

That hasn’t discouraged a whole bunch of companies from trying to get them to change their minds, including well-known software companies such as Workday and upstarts like Adaptive Insights and Anaplan.

You can now add another big name to the list of companies touting the virtues of cloud financials software: SAP.

On Monday, the German company introduced a new mobile software application, called RealSpend, that business managers can use to generate reports in real time. The app connects to corporate finance and management systems running on SAP’s HANA cloud, such as sales pipeline reports, marketing insights, inventory updates, expense inventory, and so on.

Technically speaking, SAP has sold software that helps with budget planning for some time, but not as part of its cloud services. What’s new is that RealSpend expands the audience of people who can access the data, so teams can act on issues or concerns far more quickly.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily technology newsletter.

Overall adoption for cloud financial software is still pretty modest, but the forecast is pretty optimistic. Almost 20% of companies surveyed in late 2015 by Forrester Research have replaced all or most of their accounting systems and financial tracking applications with cloud alternatives. Another 24% plan to do within two years.

There’s plenty of revenue at stake here. More than $23.1 billion will be spent on financial management software in 2016. That’s second only to what will be dedicated toward apps for managing custom relationships.

One particular beneficiary of this interest is Workday, with the number of businesses using its finance applications having doubled over the past year to almost 200 companies. It took several users to reach the 100-company market, and Workday has reorganized its sales team to capitalize on its accelerating momentum.

There are several highly visible startups angling for share—particularly when it comes to financial planning and modeling. They include Anaplan, which is in the process of hiring a new CEO and a management shakeup in late April; and Adaptive Insights, which signed up a new CFO in January.","Business managers can analyze expenses, other financial data in real time.","Generated Summary: Traditionally speaking, corporate finance teams haven’t been quick to embrace cloud financials software for their day-to-day duties."

The toy maker is selling the new limited edition toy it has called “Wonky Mr. Potato Head” in collaboration with Asda’s Wonky Veg project. Toy News reports that the effort is a way to bring awareness to food waste as well as raise funds for a charitable organization dedicated to the cause.

All proceeds from the sale will go to FareShare, which provides low-income families across the U.K. with affordable and healthy produce. The eBay auction began on June 27 and will end on July 3. At the time of writing, there have been 39 bids reaching £220, or about $293.

“It’s the taste, not the shape that counts, and the charities and community groups we support can turn them into delicious meals for people in need,” FareShare corporate development officer Daniel Nicholls told Toy News. “We are very grateful that the proceeds from this unique Wonky Mr. Potato Head auction will enable us to help those charities feed more people, and we’d encourage people to bid big. Every £1 we raise will mean we can provide enough food to make four meals for vulnerable and hungry men, women, and children here in the U.K.”

The Institution of Mechanical Engineers released a report in 2013 that stated 2 billion tons of food are wasted every year worldwide, with the U.K. leading the pack in the E.U.

283,"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is an extreme example – a really, really extreme example – of a widespread leadership problem. As mobs storm grocery stores and bakeries to avoid starvation, infant mortality rockets because hospitals lack electricity and medicine, people risk and sometimes lose their lives trying to leave the country, which is illegal – and now, we learn from the New York Times, malaria is rampaging through the country – Maduro has taken no effective action against one of the worst humanitarian crises in the Western hemisphere. Why not? Only two possible explanations seem available: He’s either clueless or evil.

Any leader whose behavior seems explainable only by those two options is in deep trouble. Maduro certainly is. His approval rating is 12%, finds a recent poll, and 83% of respondents say they’d vote to remove him given the chance. Opposition leaders have been struggling to organize a recall referendum, which apparently will not take place until next year.

But in fact, many leaders invite that same two-pronged evaluation through behavior on a far smaller scale than Maduro’s. An especially common scenario is a leader’s failure to remove a subordinate who is terrible at his or her job. Everyone who works for that person knows that he or she is damaging the organization and must go, yet the boss doesn’t act. Why not? The leader must be clueless – ignorant of what’s plain to everyone else – or evil – aware of the problem yet unwilling to fix it, for unknown reasons that cannot be good.

That situation can arise with any kind of organizational problem, not just personnel. The leader sometimes deludes himself into thinking he’s got time to act because others aren’t yet aware of the problem. Just the opposite is usually true: In most organizations, the boss is the last to know.

The no-good-explanation quandary arises also when a leader himself or herself can’t supply a better explanation for problematic behavior. It’s a non-partisan issue. Whether it’s Hillary Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server as Secretary of State or Donald Trump’s “Second Amendment people” remark last week, many voters are asking themselves: clueless or evil?

Sign up for daily insights, updates, and opinion on leadership and leaders in the news at the Power Sheet.

Leaders who stumble into this trap need to get out as fast as possible. As J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has rightly observed, a leader’s problems “do not age well.” Yet most leaders in this fix just make matters worse. Maduro is a good example. Instead of trying to reverse the course of a tragically failing economy, he’s doubling down on the disastrous policies that led there, installing a Marxist professor from Spain as his unofficial top economic adviser. In that poll cited earlier, 94% of respondents said they think the military is unable to handle food distribution. Maduro responded by elevating the military’s role, replacing the Minister of Interior and Justice with a general. Then, on Saturday, he left his chaotic country to spend the weekend in Cuba celebrating Fidel Castro’s 90th birthday.

285,"A Sydney teenager related to a convicted terrorist and accused of planning an Islamic State-inspired attack is alleged to have been planning to do ""something bigger"" than the murder of Curtis Cheng.

The boy, 16, was intercepted on a police wire in October last year talking to his mother after the NSW Police accountant was murdered, court documents reveal.

""When they come, I'm going to do something to them that they have never seen before,"" he allegedly said. ""I'm going to do something bigger.""

Police will claim the boy was drawing comparisons between himself and teen terrorist Farhad Jabar who shot the Mr Cheng outside NSW Police Force headquarters in Parramatta.

He and another 16-year-old boy are now behind bars after facing court on Thursday for allegedly possessing M9 Bayonet hunting knives in preparation to commit a terrorist act.

The pair were arrested by counter-terrorism police the day before outside a Bankstown prayer hall after allegedly purchasing the weapons from a nearby gun shop.

One boy allegedly had a handwritten note pledging allegiance to IS in his possession when he was arrested, according to court documents.

The pair were formally refused bail at Parramatta Children's Court and their cases adjourned until December 7.

Both teens were well known to counter-terror police.

One was previously caught overseas trying to enter ""an area under control of a terrorist organisation"", police will allege.

He was found in possession of electronic IS literature on his return to Australia.

The other, whose relative is behind bars for terror offences, allegedly took part in a Hyde Park protest in 2012 carrying a sign that read ""Behead those who insult the prophet"".

Authorities were unaware of any specific targets of this allegedly foiled alleged terror plot, but believed an attack was imminent.

""Had we not been in the right place at the right time ... certainly somebody, potentially today, would be, or another day imminently, would be without their life,"" AFP Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan told reporters on Thursday.

Asked if the teens were plotting a beheading, NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Cath Burn said: ""We don't have any information to indicate that, however it is an ongoing investigation.""

The teens have each been charged with planning an act of terror - which carries a penalty of life behind bars - and being members of a terrorist organisation, which carries a penalty of 10 years' prison.

Four western Sydney properties connected with the teenagers - including a prayer hall and multiple homes - were raided after the boys were taken into custody.

Items were seized for forensic examination and police have not ruled out making further arrests.

The age of the two boys is of significant concern to counter-terrorism police, who are seeing an increase in the number of radicalised teens.

""The age of these two individuals at the age of 16 is of unbelievable concern to us. We are seeing it time and time again,"" Ms Burn said.

""It's up to the parents, really, to try to do everything they can to make sure those signs of radicalisation at an early stage are addressed.""

If proved, this would be the 11th imminent terror attack prevented by the Joint Counter Terrorism Team in Australia.

Machines running the new software thought they were infected, and thus wouldn't start properly. With businesses everywhere dependent on McAfee, the result was a disaster. Some hospitals turned away patients, jails canceled visitation sessions, and in Kentucky a police department saw its communications system go down.

McAfee apologized and released a patch, and the machines were slowly nursed back to health.

""I think people talk about a bubble because it's an easy way to get on TV, … but I think these companies are doing incredible work, and by and large the valuations are reasonable,"" Altman said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Alley.""

""I don't think most VCs believe we're in a bubble. ... If they do, then they shouldn't invest in start-ups,"" said Altman, whose company provides seed money to start-ups like Airbnb, Twitch and Disqus.

Several start-ups now have multibillion-dollar valuations, including Uber, valued at over $40 billion, and Snapchat, which was valued at about $10 billion last August.

Altman said some of the venture capitalists who have made the most noise regarding these high valuations are also the ones who are pumping the most money into them. ""The VCs that are investing the most money ever in start-ups, at least in the last 10 years, are the ones that are saying there's a bubble.""

He also said these venture capitalists are exaggerating the possibility of a bubble because of their lack of control over the companies.

The country has embraced stricter guidelines and new technology for the entire nuclear industry since the 2011 tragedy, but according to Aldrich, ""the question is, for Japan to extend the life and licensing of these aging reactors, can they convince the population that these reactors are safe?""

The Sendai reactor is also located near an active volcano.

The evacuation procedures only cover areas in a 10 kilometer radius of the Sendai plant, with no detailed plan for distances outside that perimeter, he said, adding that the volcano is about 50 kilometers away from the reactor.

Read More Stock market calls the Fed's bluff

The overinflated commodity bubble, juiced by the Fed and other central bank intervention worldwide, has popped perhaps before anticipated. With low oil and other commodity prices, inflation (taken as a whole) is not only no longer a concern, but deflation has become the word du jour. The emerging markets, including the all-important ""BRIC"" countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), are struggling from the effects of years of currency and commodity manipulations. The worst of these now appears to be China. It was a stalwart while the rest of the world dealt with the last major crisis, but it is now showing signs of a major slowdown that could impact Europe and the U.S.

I have, for the last year, been in the camp that the Fed would not raise rates this year. History shows that the Fed is always a laggard and would rather be late to the party than risk being early. With a dovish head in Janet Yellen, that seems to make a strong case for history to repeat.

Moreover, looking at the worldwide landscape, which may see further currency devaluations against the U.S. dollar impacting exports, the slowdown of a major trading partner in China and the impact of lower oil prices on the energy industry in the U.S. — the one bright spot that has boosted jobs over the last few years — it seems as clear as day that the Fed cannot raise interest rates any time soon.

The man, identified as a white male in his 50s who faced a felony charge in 2009 for the illegal discharge of a weapon, was reported to police at 5.45pm on January 5.

Witnesses claimed the man fired his gun outside his apartment an estimated six to eight times prior to the arrival of police.

They said he was protesting President Obama’s recent moves to clamp down on gun accessibility with a new background check policy.

Police surrounded the scene shortly thereafter, asking the man to come out of his apartment unarmed.

297,"The Spanish Uber competitor Cabify, which is currently expanding in Latin America, has raised a $120 million Series C round of investment.

The round values the on-demand ride-hailing firm at $320 million. It was led by the Japanese web giant Rakuten rkunf , which put a fresh $92 million into Cabify — on top of the $3 million it invested last year. Before Wednesday, Cabify had reportedly raised less than $30 million.

Cabify operates in Spain, Chile, Peru, Mexico and Colombia. Indeed, in Latin America it stands alongside Uber as a focus for the ire of traditional cab companies.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Rakuten is interested in Cabify’s Latin American presence and “willingness to work with regulators.” Cabify, meanwhile, is keen on forging alliances with car manufacturers, although TechCrunch reported that no such companies participated in the current funding round.

Rakuten is also an investor in Lyft, Uber’s best-known competitor. It participated in a much larger $1 billion round for Lyft at the start of this year, which valued Lyft at $5.5 billion. Uber raised funding at the end of 2015 at a valuation of $62.5 billion, although investment firm T. Rowe Price trow recently marked down its Uber investment by 6 percent.

Cabify remains small fry on the international scale for now. That said, Rakuten clearly sees something in its regional strength.

298,"A controversial condominium project in South Boston has fallen through.

The Archdiocese of Boston and the would-be developer of the Gate of Heaven School building on East Fourth Street said Monday they had let a purchase agreement on the site expire May 31, effectively killing a project that had become a flashpoint in the debate over gentrification in Southie.

Developer Michael Moore, of Oranmore Enterprises LLC, said church officials had declined to extend his option to buy the site, where he had planned to convert the shuttered school into 26 condominiums. A spokesman for the archdiocese confirmed that the option had expired but wouldn’t say why or what might come next for the building, which has been empty since the school closed in 2008.

The project won full city approval to launch construction last year but faced stiff opposition from neighbors who feared overcrowding and called it a symbol of South Boston’s gentrification. They collected 2,000 signatures in opposition and last year launched a lawsuit that was threatening to delay development.

“WE DID IT,” wrote Kevin Lally, a leader of the Gate of Heaven Neighborhood Association in an e-mail to supporters Friday afternoon. Lally did not respond to messages Monday afternoon but in his message he said he hoped neighborhood leaders could sit down soon with church officials to discuss alternative uses for the building.

Among the projects is a planned renovation of an old naval chain factory in the Charlestown Navy Yard.

It’s not entirely clear why the project — which the archdiocese had long supported — fell through. Moore said his firm had offered more money to extend the option again, but the church declined. He said he had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars over the last two and a half years on planning and permitting.

“We had invested a lot of money, energy, and will to move this project forward,” Moore said. “We got dumped.

300,"The menu of corporate bonds the European Central Bank might consider buying is pretty broad. But it remains to be seen how big its appetite really is.

ECB President Mario Draghi Thursday gave answers to some of the questions investors have had about the corporate-bond purchase program it announced in March. Alongside purchases of other securities, this will contribute to total buying of €80 billion ($91 billion) a month, up from the €60 billion pace set when the ECB embarked on quantitative easing in 2015.

The ECB has certainly given itself broad leeway. Via six national central banks, it will buy euro-denominated bonds from nonbank companies incorporated in the eurozone, including insurance companies, with maturities of between six months and 30 years. There is no minimum issue size. The ECB will buy bonds both in primary and secondary markets, and could buy up to 70% of a single issue. And it requires just one investment-grade credit rating for a bond to be eligible for purchase.

But one big question remains: how much will the ECB buy each month? Investors probably won’t find out except in hindsight; the central bank will report its holdings weekly after purchases start in June. Citigroup C -0.33 % thinks purchases of €3 billion to €5 billion might drive the market up when investors are bullish, but not be enough to offset outflows if the tone turns bearish. Purchases of €5 billion to €10 billion a month would have a big impact, Société Générale SCGLY -0.35 % argues, given already strong demand from investors.

Of course, the ECB’s plan has already moved the market. Issuance of corporate bonds has picked up sharply in the wake of March’s announcement. Yields have fallen and the gap between corporate and government bond yields compressed. The premium for new issuance versus existing bonds has collapsed as investor appetite for new paper has risen.

But large-scale corporate-bond purchases could still have fairly significant consequences over time. Debt from eurozone issuers trades at a tighter spread than for borrowers from elsewhere in the world, meaning there could be greater demand for the latter from investors. Thus ECB policy could contribute to further leverage piling up on U.S. corporate balance sheets. And the willingness of the ECB to buy long-maturity bonds could further boost issuance of such debt, even though it isn’t clear that there is natural, sustainable demand in the absence of the current frantic search for yield.

If the ECB proves serious about buying corporate bonds, then expect a market that is already being distorted to get even trickier to trade.",The ECB is looming over the eurozone corporate bond market. Investors face a competitor with deep pockets.,Generated Summary: The menu of corporate bonds the European Central Bank might consider buying is pretty broad.

301,"Using a herpes virus to wipe out European carp plaguing the Murray River could ultimately kill off native fish as well, a researcher warns.

The plan, dubbed ""Carpageddon"", is slated to begin in late 2018 and will eradicate 95 per cent of the pest's population over the next 30 years.

While the virus doesn't affect other fish, University of Adelaide research shows that decomposing carp, if they're left in the water, will dissolve oxygen levels.

And this will endanger native species such as Murray cod and silver perch, as well as crustaceans.

""If we're removing oxygen from the water column, native fish will die because they have a much lower tolerance to low oxygen levels than carp,"" honours student Richie Walsh told AAP on Sunday.

He said native populations would start to suffer with oxygen levels of less than 4mg per litre, and that huge numbers of dead carp could bring it down to at least this level.

""It would be ironic. In trying to remove the carp we'd be potentially causing extinctions in local native fish,"" Mr Walsh said.

""Obviously it's a good idea to remove carp but not without trying to figure out what the side effects will be.

""We've had carp in these sorts of numbers for about 60 years.

We should do the research.""",University of Adelaide research reveals that a plan to wipe out European carp populations in the Murray River could end up wreaking havoc with native fish.,"Generated Summary: Using a herpes virus to wipe out European carp plaguing the Murray River could ultimately kill off native fish as well, a researcher warns."
302,"Some of Australia's biggest corporate high-flyers are banding together to give a multi-million dollar funding injection into some of the nation's most disadvantaged schools.

Renowned businessman David Gonski has joined Commonwealth Bank boss Ian Narev, media mogul Kerry Stokes and former newspaper boss John B Fairfax to donate $5.25 million over five years to hundreds of disadvantaged students.

Their Pioneers in Philanthropy group is working in partnership with Schools Plus, a charity that matches needy schools with philanthropists and businesses to fund education programs for pupils and their teachers.

Mr Gonski, who led a wideranging review of Australia's education funding in 2011, said philanthropists could help address education inequality by supporting specific programs that disadvantaged schools can't usually afford.

""With the right support, these children are just as capable of achieving magnificent things,"" he said.

""We owe it to them to create the environment that enables them to thrive so that in turn, Australia as a nation can thrive.""

Schools Plus, which was set up following a recommendation in the Gonski review, has donated $2.5 million to about 90 needy schools running programs ranging from science and technology projects through to ones that help newly arrived migrant students and their families adjust to school life in Australia.

Schools apply for funding from the charity, whose panel of education experts select the ones they believe will deliver great outcomes for students.

Schools Plus chief executive Rosemary Conn says about 300 schools had applied for funding in the past 18 months.

""There's certainly a lot more demand than there is supply,"" she told AAP.

""We're hearing from schools from all over the country.""

Elle Hidson, principal at Canley Heights Public School in Sydney's southwest, says she felt like her pupils and teachers ""hit the jackpot"" when they were matched a year ago with a company that runs a technology and learning centre at the school once a week for about 50 students.

Under the program, students can access computers and other tech devices they don't have at home and learn new skills such as coding. Teachers are also taught how to brush up on their tech skills.

""These partnerships we have are priceless,"" Ms Hidson said.

Being able to help students in rural and remote areas was a major attraction for John B Fairfax, who donates to Pioneers in Philanthropy through his family's trust, Jibb.

""There are difficulties in education for a lot of people, particularly in rural and remote areas and this whole program strives to overcome some of those difficulties,"" said Mr Fairfax, who set up regional newspaper group Rural Press before merging it with his family's Fairfax media empire.

In an April 24 letter to one manufacturer,

, the agency noted that its product Velocity listed AMP as a dietary ingredient. AMP is also known as 1,3-Dimethylbutylamine, DMBA, 2-amino-4-methylpentane and methyl-2-pentanamine.

The FDA said it considered Velocity adulterated because there isn't enough information to provide reasonable assurance that DMBA is safe.

%VIRTUAL-pullquote-[T]he FDA has now made it extremely clear to manufacturers that there is no justification to sell DMBA in supplements.%Earlier this month the agency warned five companies to stop selling dietary supplements containing a stimulant known as beta-methylphenylethylamine, or BMPEA, which is often hidden in supplements containing Acacia rigidula.

The FDA actions come amid pressure from lawmakers and a Harvard University academic, Dr. Pieter Cohen, who has been studying the presence of synthetic stimulants in supplements.

""This is extremely welcome news,"" Cohen said. ""Rather than waiting until heart attacks, strokes or deaths are definitely linked to this new designer stimulant, the FDA has now made it extremely clear to manufacturers that there is no justification to sell DMBA in supplements.""

Last year Cohen published a study showing DMBA was present in 12 supplements marketed to improve athletic performance, increase weight loss and enhance brain function. He also pointed out that products containing BMPEA were still on the market a year after FDA researchers discovered the stimulant in Acacia rigidula supplements.

DMBA and BMPEA are similar to 1,3-dimethylamylamine, or DMAA, which has already been banned by the FDA.

The FDA banned a stimulant known as ephedra in 2004. Since then, companies have tried to replace it with other stimulants purported to be natural.

307,"For the nearly fifty million Americans living below the poverty line and the more than hundred thousand teetering on the brink, education can be a lifeline to a better future. According to a survey conducted among low-income women for this year’s “Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Pushes Back from the Brink,” three out of four of the women surveyed wished they had put more of a priority on their education and career. Just 58% of Americans among all income levels agreed.

Yet a half a century after President John F. Kennedy signed legislation making gender-based waged disparity illegal, women are still earning less than men who hold the same job. After decades of movement toward parity, the average female-to-male earnings ratio has flatlined at a rate of 77 cents to the dollar. It remains virtually unchanged since 2001.

But a deeper look into the data reveals that women of all education levels – even women who hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees—are plagued by a persistent wage gap. According to a study by the American Association of University Women, women who are one year out of college earn 7% less than their male counterparts, even when they earned the same degree, at the same kind of school, and are doing the same job for the same number of hours per week.

The wage gap widens with higher educational attainment: Women who hold a graduate or professional degree earn on average 75.6 cents on each dollar earned by a man with the same level of education in the same position. For women with a college degree, that number ticks up slightly to 79.5 cents on the dollar– virtually in lockstep with women who haven’t earned a high school diploma.

“Overall, a woman with a college degree doing the same work as a man will earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less over the course of her career,” President Obama said at a White House Forum on Women and the Economy in April 2012. “Closing this pay gap—ending this pay discrimination—is about far more than simple fairness, it’s about strengthening families, communities and our entire economy,” he wrote in an op-ed a few days later.

According to the Center for Women’s Policy Research, the U.S. economy could produce $447.6 billion in additional income if women were paid an equivalent wage to that of their male counterparts.

309,"Jerome Schlichter, a lawyer who has taken on retirement plan fees across the country, on Tuesday filed lawsuits against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other schools, alleging that they have failed to protect employees from tens of millions of dollars in excess costs.

Schlichter, based in St. Louis, has had success with such lawsuits in the private sector, suing the likes of technology giant Oracle Corp. of Redwood City, Calif., and Boston-based Fidelity Investments for allowing workers to be overcharged on 401(k) fees.

Now he’s taking the fight to the nonprofit sector, with class-action lawsuits filed against MIT, Yale University, and New York University. Together, the institutions’ contributory retirement plans cover some 60,000 current and former employees.

“These are the first cases in the university space,’’ Schlichter said in an interview. Over the past decade, his firm has filed 20 lawsuits against private employers, alleging that they have not done their job keeping costs in retirement plans as low as possible for their workers.

MIT’s plan had $3.6 billion in assets at the end of 2014 and 18,268 participants, according to one lawsuit, filed in federal court in Boston. Until last year, it had offered employees 340 mutual funds and other investment options, a large number compared with many plans.

More than half the fund offerings were also managed by Fidelity, and carried higher costs than, for instance, passively managed index funds.

A year ago, MIT eliminated hundreds of mutual funds provided under the plan, narrowing the lineup to 37 investment options, according to the lawsuit.

As firms that manage money and administer retirement accounts for employers have incentives to maximize fees, Schlichter said, the employers “have the ultimate fiduciary duty” to their workers.

Fidelity has been the recordkeeper at MIT since 1999, with many of its own funds in the plan, Schlichter alleged. The university has not put the contract out to bid over those years, he said.

An MIT spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokesman for Fidelity, which had just learned of the lawsuit, had no immediate comment.","MIT, Yale, and New York University have been sued over fees paid on their retirement funds by a lawyer who has won settlements in similar cases against companies.","Generated Summary: Jerome Schlichter, a lawyer who has taken on retirement plan fees across the country, alleging that they have failed to protect employees from tens of millions of dollars in excess costs."

312,"Small-business owners' confidence took a dive in the first part of the year and many say the presidential election is weighing on their minds, according to a survey released Monday by Capital One.

The March national survey of some 400 for-profit small businesses, defined as having less than $10 million in annual revenue, revealed subdued hiring plans and worsening perceptions of the economy.

Just 26 percent of respondents said they plan to hire employees in the next six months, compared with 32 percent who said so this time last year and 37 percent who said so during the last election in 2012.

The share of small-business owners who said current business conditions are ""excellent or good"" dropped to 41 percent from 50 percent last year, while the share who identified business conditions as ""poor"" rose to 19 percent from 15 percent. More respondents also reported decreased sales.

The small business ""confidence score,"" which takes into account economic sentiment, hiring plans, recent sales and future outlook, had been trending upward since the end of 2012 but slid over the past year.

""We have seen a retraction of some sentiment,"" said Brian Smith, senior vice president for small business banking at Capital One. ""There's a caution around investing.""

Asked what they are most concerned about in 2016, a quarter of respondents named the upcoming presidential election.

Asked to name the greatest issue of concern when evaluating the presidential candidates, by far the most common answer was tax policies on small businesses.

Other findings surprised Smith, including the slow adoption of technology that can help owners manage and market their businesses. For example, 40 percent don't use social media at all for their businesses.

In addition, the percentage of small businesses offering 401(k) plans to employees fell sharply to 13 percent from 24 percent at the end of 2014, Smith said.

The report emphasized that some business owners remain optimistic, with 39 percent expecting to be in a better financial position in the next six months. About half expect financial conditions to be the same.

Millennial business owners were far more likely than their older counterparts to be optimistic and to report hiring and sales growth.

Capital One's Spark Business Barometer, which was published quarterly through last year and is now being released twice a year, is a national survey.

Locally, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce this year released its second annual small business survey that also revealed declining confidence in the economy. But the survey, which polled 574 businesses with fewer than 500 employees, found respondents were more optimistic about their own plans for growth, said Katie Fitzpatrick, executive director of programs at the chamber.

""We don't want to cast a gloomy shadow,"" Fitzpatrick said, though some of the findings from that report, released in January, were gloomy.

Just 16 percent of the respondents said they believed Illinois' economy would strengthen in the next year, down from 32 percent who thought so a year earlier, before the state's legislators entered a budget impasse now approaching the 12-month mark.

Just under 30 percent said they believed the Chicago area's economy will improve this year, down from 42 percent who said so a year before. There was more confidence in the U.S. economy, with 47 percent of respondents expecting improvement, down slightly from 54 percent last year, according to the chamber's survey.

But three-quarters of respondents said they planned to grow their business in the next year and 60 percent expect higher sales in the future. More than 40 percent said they planned to hire, which was not statistically different from last year's results, but Fitzgerald said many small businesses grow by developing marketing or business plans rather than taking a risk on new hires.

About 97 percent of the Chicago area's businesses have 20 employees or fewer, Fitzpatrick said.","Small-business owners' confidence took a dive in the first part of the year and many say the presidential election is weighing on their minds, according to a survey released Monday by Capital One.","Generated Summary: Small-business owners' confidence took a dive in the first part of the year and many say the presidential election is weighing on their minds, according to a survey released Monday by Capital One."

The 23-story-tall Falcon 9 rocket, built and flown by Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 12:45 a.m. EDT.

Perched on top of the rocket was a Dragon capsule filled with nearly 5,000 pounds of food, supplies and equipment, including a miniature DNA sequencer, the first to fly in space.

Also aboard the capsule was a metal docking ring of diameter 7.8 feet, that will be attached to the station, letting commercial spaceships under development by SpaceX and Boeing Co. ferry astronauts to the station, a $100-billion laboratory that flies about 250 miles above Earth.

The manned craft are scheduled to begin test flights next year.

Since NASA retired its fleet of space shuttles five years ago, the United States has depended on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the station, at a cost of more than $70 million per person.

As the Dragon cargo ship began its two-day journey to the station, the main section of the Falcon 9 booster rocket separated and flew itself back to the ground, touching down a few miles south of its seaside launch pad, accompanied by a pair of sonic booms.

316,"Iowa Senator Joni Ernst introduced legislation this week to prohibit U.S. armed forces facilities from establishing “Meatless Monday,” suggesting that such a program might leave soldiers without adequate meat protein.

The Ernst proposal—technically an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act—cites the federal government’s dietary guidelines as reason to ensure that members of the armed forces get enough meat. The guidelines do suggest that protein from meat plays a key part in a healthy eating pattern, but the document also says that the average American man gets too much of that protein from meat. Instead of relying on meat, the guidelines recommend diversifying the diet with seafood, nuts and beans.

In an emailed statement, Ernst described Meatless Mondays as “misguided at best” and in conflict with dietary standards. “Our men and women in uniform should have the option to consume the protein they need, including meat, on a daily basis,” she said.

The Ernst proposal comes as the Humane Society has made inroads promoting Meatless Monday—abstaining from meat on that day of the week—for members of the armed services. The animal welfare group provides training and recipes to help facilities reduce their meat consumption. The group helped the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut cut meat consumption by 10% in three years, according to a Politico report.

More broadly, the Meatless Monday phenomenon has spread to offices and cafeterias across the country. Supporters of the movement cite growing evidence that a plant-based diet is linked to a variety of health benefits and heavy meat consumption exacts a heavy toll on the environment.

317,"Family and friends of Byron Bay woman Sara Connor, who has been named a suspect in the murder of a police officer in Bali, say the accusations against her are ""out of character"".

The body of Wayan Sudarsa was found on Kuta beach around 3am local time on Wednesday (5.30am AEST), with more than 40 injuries to his body including wounds to his head and neck.

A smashed beer bottle was found near his body, as well as a handbag with the driver’s license and credit card of Ms Connor.

Ms Connor and British man David Taylor were arrested near the Australian Consulate-General in Denpasar on Friday after police put out an immigration alert in a bid to stop them from leaving the island.

Under Indonesian law they can not be charged until prosecutors decide to take the matter to court.

If charged and found guilty, Ms Connor faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.

After spending their first night in custody in Bali, Ms Connor and Mr Taylor were taken to Kuta Beach at dawn where they were asked to carry out a re-enactment.

The mother-of-two reportedly told officers she was drunk at the time and can’t remember all of the events of the night.

""(We) wanted to find out the suspects' position during the incident and the suspects admitted that they were there,"" Denpasar District Police Chief Hadi Purnomo said on Saturday.

They were also taken to the nearby Kubu Kau Beach Inn - the hotel where Mr Taylor was staying before heading to Trijata Hospital in Denpasar.

Here Ms Connor was met with a small group of local media. She covered her face with a sarong and didn't make any comment.

Family and friends of Ms Connor released a statement today saying ""Sara is a very honest, reliable and generous person. The accusations laid against her are totally out of character for this beautiful person"".

Balinese police had initially incorrectly identified Ms Connor’s companion. They have since corrected their error.

Mr Taylor is believed to have entered Bali on July 29 while Ms Connor came on August 16.

While researchers studied 15 people whose deaths were allegedly linked to marijuana use, 13 of those deaths were confirmed to be caused by other factors. Researchers said, however, that the drug was to blame in two isolated cases of two seemingly health people, one 23 years old and another 28. Autopsies found that younger had a serious undetected heart problem, suggesting that people with cardiological issues should be aware of marijuana risks, and the older had a history of alcohol and drug use.

“To our knowledge, these are the first cases of suspected fatal cannabis intoxications where full post-mortem investigations… were carried out,” researchers said in the study, published in Forensic Science International this month. “After exclusion of other causes of death we assume that the young men experienced fatal cardiovascular complications evoked by smoking cannabis.”

The new study cuts against many others showing pot use does not have serious medical repercussions. The German Association for Drugs and Addiction criticized the study on Wednesday, The Local reports.

324,"Under Armour is sneaking into the 3D-printed shoes craze with the launch of a very limited-edition performance training shoe that will go on sale later this month.

The Baltimore-based athletic gear maker is the latest to experiment with the innovative manufacturing process that has already lured rivals including New Balance, Nike nke and Adidas addyy .

This week, Under Armour ua said the UA Architech features a 3D printed midsole and a 3D upper design that helps provide a precision fit. The training shoe was conceptualized during a two-year research and development process that Under Armour says involved the study of geometric shapes and structures to come up with the midsole design. In 3D printing, computerized machines layer material to create three-dimensional objects.

The UA Architech won’t move the sales needle too much for Under Armour, as the initial run of this line of shoes will only be for 96 pairs. The product will retail at $299.99 each and go on sale on March 18.

While 3D printed shoes may not generate high sales volume today, it is important for shoe makers like Under Armour to experiment with how that form of manufacturing can help augment the design and construction process for the company’s shoes.

Still, footwear remains a strong growth channel for Under Armour. Sales for that category soared 57% to $677.7 million in 2015 from the prior year, far outpacing the 22% jump for the larger apparel category. Under Armour, now 20 years old, only entered the footwear market a decade ago but is quickly gobbling up a bigger piece of the pie.

Investments in product innovation within the footwear category have helped Under Armour gain market share recently, analysts have reported, though much of the gains have been attributed to increased sales of basketball shoes. Under Armour’s relationship with NBA all-star Stephen Curry has been particularly lucrative.

Within the running and training categories, Under Armour still commands a slim market share. Larger rival Nike commands sizable market share across all the footwear divisions it competes in, so brands like Under Armour have a lot of room to grow–but also face a strong rival to win market share.","Nike, Adidas have also experimented with the technology.",Generated Summary: Under Armour is sneaking into the 3D-printed shoes craze with the launch of a very limited-edition performance training shoe that will go on sale later this month.

Until 1893 it was a capital offence to attempt to emigrate from the Middle Kingdom. Tens of thousands of Chinese nevertheless embarked on the perilous sea crossing to escape poverty and corruption, as we learn at the Chinatown Heritage Centre in Singapore. This surprising museum is devoted to the Chinese boat people who landed on the Malay peninsula in the late 19th century, on the heels of its British colonists, and ultimately reached the island at its tip.

In 1930 alone, some 250,000 Chinese workers or porters, then referred to as coolies, arrived. But Singapore did not regard immigrants as a separate category. Regardless of their origins in China, Malaysia or India, they formed the basis of the Singaporean nation, a melting pot from the outset and proud of its four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. Drawing attention to this hybrid background, Singapore (population 4.5 million) has made the development of culture and the arts a national priority for the coming decade.

Coinciding with this initiative the Musée Branly in Paris has staged an exhibition entitled Baba Bling, Domestic Signs of Prosperity in Singapore (until 30 January). It features more than 500 artefacts – furniture, porcelain, embroidered costumes and beaded slippers, among others – belonging to the Peranakan Chinese community.

According to the historian JD Vaughan, writing in the 1870s, the Straits Chinese (born in the colonised territories of the Malay archipelago) were known as ""Babas"", to distinguish them from their fellows born on the mainland. He noted their excessive taste for brandy, billiards and clubs, but also their attachment to traditional Chinese dress.

In fact their place of birth was not the key characteristic of the Babas (literally ""a Chinese person""), or more largely the Peranakan community (which simply means ""son of"" in Malay). Baba also refers to the descendants of Chinese migrants who settled in the Malay archipelago (now Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore) as early as the 14th century, and married non-Muslim native women.

The Peranakan Chinese formed a cultivated, often prosperous caste, speaking English and Malay, but continuing to practise the religious rites of their ancestors, with a mixture of Taoist and Buddhist influences. They served as go-betweens for the British traders. There were other Peranakan communities, such as the (Indian Muslim) Jawi or the (Hindu) Melaka Chitty, but the Chinese community was the largest and the most influential in Singapore. Sadly this is no longer the case.

Peter Lee is the curator of the Baba House, Singapore's last authentic Peranakan home. He is not quite as nostalgic as others. ""We are constantly negotiating between our roots and the dream of our roots,"" he says. ""We have this ability to exist in several worlds at the same time.""

According to some linguists there are now only about 10,000 Peranakan left, but their story is attracting unprecedented media attention. A Peranakan museum opened in 2008. The same year The Little Nonya, a television serial that tells the story of a Peranakan family over three generations, attracted a record number of viewers. And then there are restaurants, embroidery and cooking classes, conferences, articles and books all devoted to Baba culture.

On the other hand there is no mention of the darker side of Peranakan history, in particular in the 1940s, when Singapore was under Japanese occupation. As allies of the defeated British, many Babas fled abroad, earning them a reputation as traitors.

Attention focuses exclusively on the glamorous side of the Peranakan. ""They are the multiracial emblems of our social mix,"" says Singapore's arts and information minister, Lui Tuck Yew.

No one in Singapore would contradict that view. The city-state, with its authoritarian, free-market values, gained its independence from Malaysia in 1965 and is now determined to assert its identity, much as it did when it developed its economy, cleaned up the city and built reservoirs. Certainly no Baba in his right mind would claim that culture is heaven-sent.

Technology companies led the gains, with Apple, Google, and Intel rising at least 5.5 percent. Amazon.com surged 7.4 percent, and Netflix posted a two-day gain of 14 percent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup rose more than 4.8 percent, while Cameron International soared 41 percent after agreeing to be bought by Schlumberger Ltd. in a $14.8 billion deal.

Gains in equities accelerated in the final hour as the Standard & Poor’s 500 climbed 3.9 percent, halting a six-day slide that was its steepest in four years. The Dow Jones industrial average added 4 percent; the Nasdaq Composite 4.2 percent, its strongest increase since August 2011. About 10.7 billion shares traded hands on US exchanges, 55 percent above the three-month average.

“This type of short-term rally shouldn’t be much surprise, given recent weakness,” said Chad Morganlander, at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. “Eventually the reality that valuations have come off so much will come into play.”

The turmoil in global stock markets, sparked by growth concerns, has reduced expectations for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates as soon as next month. The New York Fed’s president, William Dudley, said Wednesday that the upheaval has reduced the case for raising rates in September, and cautioned that it’s important not to overreact to short-term events.

American investors are facing their first major test of buy-and-hold advice since the financial crisis.

Traders are pricing in a one-in-four chance the central bank will act at its next meeting, down from almost even odds before China’s surprise currency devaluation earlier this month.

Fed policy makers remain focused on economic data. A report Wednesday showed orders for capital goods increased in July by the most in more than a year, indicating corporate spending was finding its footing prior to the turmoil in the financial markets. Orders for all durable goods — items meant to last at least three years — rose 2 percent.

More than $2 trillion had been erased from American equity values since the S&P 500 started its losing streak, breaking a calm in a stock market that had gone almost four years without a 10 percent correction. The measure plunged 11 percent in the six days through Tuesday, the most since the United States was stripped of its AAA credit rating by S&P in August 2011, and was 1 percent away from erasing its gains since the end of 2013.

“It’s definitely a positive to see markets move higher,” said Tom Manning, at Boston Private Wealth, which oversees about $9 billion in assets. “I don’t know that we found the bottom. I’m not convinced we don’t have more negative days to follow. We’re not likely to go from extreme volatility to extreme calm overnight.”

331,"The quickening early pace of the 2016 presidential race has produced a striking partisan contrast: A lopsided, locked-in Democratic contest and a highly movable Republican one.

That portrait emerged from the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Despite a recent barrage of critical news stories about the finances of her family's foundation and her former-president husband, ex-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton still leads prospective Republican rivals. And while negative views of Mrs. Clinton have risen slightly among the public overall, the stories haven't budged her reputation among fellow Democrats, who view her positively rather than negatively by a margin of 81 percent to 6 percent.

""These numbers seem to be remarkably stable,"" said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who helps conduct the NBC/WSJ poll.

Yet that's not true of the increasingly crowded Republican field, which is apparently growing by a total of three this week with the announcement of the candidacy of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee after announcements by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and one-time Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. They're hoping to get the same boost in standing that poll found for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, each of whom saw a rise of at least 10 percent in the proportion of Republican primary voters who say they'll consider voting for them.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush enjoyed an even greater gain though he hasn't yet announced and is receiving a corresponding burst of concentrated attention. In March, just 49 percent of Republican primary voters said they could see themselves backing him, while 40 percent said they could not.

Now, after Mr. Bush has traveled the country ""exploring"" a campaign, 70 percent say they could, while just 27 percent say they could not. He leads the divided GOP field with 23 percent support to 18 percent for Rubio, 14 percent for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, 11 percent for Cruz and Paul and 7 percent for Carson.

""When you see this kind of volatility,"" McInturff explained, ""attitudes are very fluid.""

Clinton leads potential Republican foes by margins ranging from 4 percentage points (over Paul) to 10 percentage points (over Walker). By contrast, the survey shows Mr. Bush leading by 8 percentage points in a potential matchup with Vice President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.

One factor buoying Mrs. Clinton is the gradually improving standing of President Barack Obama. For the first time in two years, more Americans approve of his job performance (48 percent) than disapprove (47 percent). Though just 40 percent approve his handling of foreign policy, 49 percent approve his handling of the economy. Obama retains a stronger personal favorability rating than Clinton or any Republican candidate.

Read MoreWhy the presidential candidates are trumpeting small business

The backdrop of the race is deep concern about stagnant middle-class incomes and rising anxiety about conflict abroad. Fully 68 percent say they worry more about the inability of the middle and working class to get ahead more than the gap between rich and poor.

Job creation and economic growth is the top issue overall, named by 29 percent of Americans; among Democratic primary voters, 37 percent call it the top issue. But a 27 percent plurality of Republican primary voters call national security and terrorism their chief concern.

One bright spot for advocates of trade expansion in both parties—including Obama and GOP leaders of the House and Senate—is that the improving economy has lifted the share of Americans who believe trade has benefited the country. It's now 37 percent, up from 23 percent in November 2010.

Specifically, Americans say by 29 percent to 26 percent that the North American Free Trade Agreement has helped the economy more than hurt it. In a September 2003 poll, assessments were negative by a 2-to-1 margin.

SunTrust Robinson Humphreys analyst Robert Peck yesterday issued a report listing 10 possible successors for Mayer as CEO of Yahoo. The report by itself might not have meant much; speculating about CEO succession is a favorite spectator sport on Wall Street. The bad news is that Yahoo YHOO stock went up, apparently in response to Peck’s report.

The bigger picture is that a consensus seems to be forming around the view that Mayer’s rescue plan for the company isn’t working. Most notably, many of the company’s high-level executives are bailing, more than a dozen of them in the past year. At least three media outlets (Re/code, the WSJ, and Forbes) have reported independently that at a meeting of top managers in October, Mayer demanded that they promise to stay with the company for the next three to five years. That’s a desperation move, and soon afterward, more executives quit.

Customers, which are mainly advertisers, are rendering their verdict, and it isn’t hopeful: Revenues came in way below expectations last quarter, and the company cut its forecast of revenue for this quarter. Operating profit plunged last quarter as the company continues to spend big on implementing Mayer’s strategy, which is costing more than it’s bringing in. That pattern isn’t always bad; new strategies often start out that way. But Mayer has been CEO for three-and-a-half years now, and the Internet is a fast moving environment. At this point you’d expect at least a few more encouraging signs. Her stated outlook for the business suggests she doesn’t have any strategic bullets left to fire.

Which is why the most important constituents determining Mayer’s fate, investors, also seem to be concluding that the game is pretty well lost. Virtually all of Yahoo’s market cap is accounted for by the value of its holdings of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan plus its net cash. Its operating businesses are worth almost nothing, investors say. The market reaction to Robert Peck’s report yesterday is the latest sign that investors have had enough. Mayer could apparently join that exclusive club of former CEOs—Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer and Abercrombie & Fitch’s Mike Jeffries are other members—who announce that they’re stepping down with no successor named, and the stock goes up.

Is it possible that Mayer herself believes the Yahoo rescue story is nearing its end? Absolutely nothing she has said publicly would suggest so; to the contrary, she remains stridently upbeat. But she has hired the McKinsey consulting firm, reportedly for advice on where to cut costs, where to invest, and what to sell. That could be step two in unwinding the business, step one being the planned spin-off of the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan holdings into a separate entity, as urged by activist investor Jeffrey Smith of Starboard Value Fund.

In that scenario, Mayer wouldn’t be replaced as CEO. She would be the last CEO. We’re still a long way from any of that happening. But if it’s true that saving a troubled Internet company is impossible, as many in Silicon Valley believe, then it could be the best outcome for Yahoo’s long suffering shareholders.

Inmates Joseph Cruz, 32, and Lionel Clah, 29, were taken from the Penitentiary of New Mexico in a van toward the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility when they fled, the New Mexico Corrections Department said in a statement Thursday.

It appeared that corrections officers in charge of transporting the men did not check on the prisoners during the two stops, New Mexico Corrections Secretary Gregg Marcantel told the AP.

""Somehow we failed,"" Marcantel said. ""We just don't have the detail at this point.""

Cruz was sentenced to prison in Nov. 2006 for first-degree murder, attempted murder in the first degree and child abuse, according to the Corrections Department. Clah was convicted in April 2009 of armed robbery with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and assault with intent to commit a violent felony upon a peace officer.

Both men were fully shackled with leg irons, belly chains and handcuffs, and were wearing white paper transport suits, the statement said.

The escapees were spotted on surveillance video at an intersection Albuquerque around 4:30 a.m. MST, state police told NBC affiliate KOB Thursday evening. Police said they now believe the inmates are in Albuquerque or northern New Mexico.

In the video, Clah wore a red or maroon shirt with a white design, blue jeans and dark shoes, according to KOB. He was also wearing a brown hoodie.

Cruz wore eye glasses, a tan or light brown long-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, and white shoes.

Albuquerque police had set up a perimeter in the northwest part of the city at 6 p.m. MST, where a police spokesman told KOB the inmates are believed to be.

Albuquerque police came close to catching two men believed to be the escaped inmates after that perimeter was set up, Albuquerque police said Thursday evening.

Police acting on a tip followed a car in the city before the two suspected inmates and a woman bailed out and fled on foot, police said at a 7 p.m. news conference, according to KOB.

The men escaped, but the woman was taken into custody and is being questioned, police said. Police warned residents in the area to lock their doors. As of 9:50 p.m. neither inmate had been found, and officials were unsure how long the search would last.

Cruz has a tattoo reading ""Alias"" on the back of his neck, a tribal symbol on his right ear and the phrase ""13 smiley"" on his right elbow,"" officials said. Clah has a feather tattoo on his left cheekbone and multiple tattoos on his arms. They should be considered armed and dangerous.

The incident is being investigated by the New Mexico State Police Department.

335,"The news that Walmart is suing Visa to allow consumers to punch in a personal identification number when they use their chip-enabled debit cards has renewed public interest in what those chips are doing in their credit and debit cards anyway.

First, understand that the battle between two of America’s largest companies is a touch esoteric for the average consumer. Walmart is pushing for shoppers to be able to use so-called “chip-and-PIN” verification for debit cards, which requires them to punch in a personal identification code to verify purchases. Visa, on the other hand, contends that signing for chip-card purchases is sufficiently secure to reduce in-person fraud, the problem that these embedded computer chips are trying to solve in the first place.

While this is ostensibly a battle over how best to protect your financial information, Walmart and Visa are fighting over money, too. The Wall Street Journal reports that “Walmart pays Visa about five cents more per signature transaction than it does for those that use a PIN,” according to a person familiar with the rates.

Security experts generally agree that requiring shoppers to enter a PIN with their chip-enabled card is more secure than a simple signature. Banks, of course, don’t want to introduce anything into the purchasing process that might stop you from using your card and worry that remembering a PIN might be too onerous for consumers.

In either case, shoppers and merchants alike have had a rocky time adjusting to the implementation of chip cards and the special terminals needed to read them. The new cards require dipping rather than swiping, and that dipping takes any number of seconds longer—as much as 20 seconds longer, some merchants have reported. Stores have not rushed to buy and install these terminals, fearing an interruption of spending, especially during last year’s holiday season. MasterCard, which along with Visa and Europay created the so-called EMV standard, acknowledges that merchants haven’t gotten on board as quickly as they expected.

There are other issues with these cards too. One consequence of making in-person fraud more difficult is that hackers have been moving to online fraud. That wasn’t unexpected by payment processors—when the U.K. transitioned to EMV cards in the mid-2000s, online and phone-related fraud jumped nearly 200%, while in-person fraud declined—so in the future you’ll likely see an increase in two-factor authentication, perhaps even involving biometrics like fingerprints, to whack that mole. That could add even more delays at the terminal.

At this point you may be wondering—what was wrong with the old system? Why can’t I just avoid the longer wait and swipe my card like I used to?

It’s easy to understand why consumers don’t want to change behavior, because ultimately we’re not on the hook for fraud. If someone steals your credit-card information, you don’t bear the cost; banks and merchants do. So the parties that have to pay for theft want to reduce theft, even if in the short term it means introducing technology that may make consumers grumble.

There is one upside. Perhaps the palpable frustration over EMV will hasten the adoption of faster and more secure mobile payments, most of which will work with the new chip-reader terminals. But until that happens, consumers have no choice but to countenance the extra wait as best as they can.","Walmart is suing Visa to allow consumers to use a PIN with their chip-enabled debit cards, highlighting a problem with the new technology.",Generated Summary: The news that Walmart is suing Visa to allow consumers to punch in a personal identification number when they use their chip-enabled debit cards has renewed public interest in what those chips are doing in their credit and debit cards has renewed public interest in what those chips are doing in their credit and debit cards anyway.

Government and Kurdish forces were carrying out a mop-up operation in several neighbourhoods in search for Islamic State fighters who might have been injured during clashes in the city, a security source says.

Other suicide militants blew themselves up while they were besieged by security forces, the source said on condition of anonymity.

Islamic State extremists on Friday mounted a major offensive in Kirkuk, attacking several facilities including a power plant in response to an ongoing onslaught by Iraqi forces to retake Mosul, the radical militia's key stronghold in the country.

""The security situation in Kirkuk is heading towards stability,"" a local police officer said. ""Our forces are in full control of the city.""

At least 47 Iraqi troops and 39 militants have been killed in the Kirkuk violence, according to a local security source. Kirkuk is located around 170km from Mosul, which has been under Islamic State's control since mid-2014.

Government forces, backed by Kurdish forces and a US-led air alliance, started a long-awaited campaign on Monday to drive Islamic State from Mosul, Iraq's second-biggest city.

Iraqi troops on Saturday mounted a major attack to recapture a mostly Christian town near Mosul from Islamic State, state television al-Iraqi reported.

The Ninth Armoured Division, backed by US-led warplanes, stormed the town of Hamdaniyah, around 20km southeast of Mosul, the broadcaster said.

The forces reached the centre of Hamdaniyah, also known as Qaraqosh, retook the town's main hospital and raised the Iraqi flag over it.

Islamic State seized Hamdaniyah in August 2014, forcing a mass exodus from the town.

Passengers won’t be able to call deaf or hard-of-hearing drivers; they’ll only be able to relay special pick-up directions by text. Passengers will receive a notification that their driver is deaf or heard-of-hearing, and they’ll get an extra prompt to input their destination.

Thursday’s announcement could be seen as an attempt by Uber to improve its reputation or gain a competitive edge. Disabled passengers have sued Uber in the past for discrimination. One lawsuit by the National Federation of the Blind of California, for example, says an UberX driver stuffed a blind passenger’s guide dog in the trunk and refused to stop the car to let the animal out. Other drivers allegedly refused to pick up blind customers accompanied by dogs.

Uber has denied the allegations, saying that it doesn’t discriminate and can pick up blind passengers. In responding to another lawsuit, Uber argued that as a technology company, it is not subject to laws regulating public transit and other transportation providers, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act.

341,"Heroin use in the United States has skyrocketed, spreading to include groups who previously were less likely to abuse the drug.

New data released Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that heroin use increased 63% between 2002 and 2013, and heroin-related overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled over the same time period. In 2013 an estimated 517,000 people reported that they had used heroin in the last year or had a heroin-related dependence, a 150% increase from 2007. More than 8,200 people died of heroin-related overdose in 2013, according to national surveys published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

While heroin use continues to be most common among men between the ages of 18 and 25 who make less than $20,000, the CDC researchers note that in recent years people in nearly every demographic group are using the drug more. For instance, heroin use has doubled among women and non-Hispanic white people.

MORE: Why You Don’t Know About the Heroin Vaccine

“Heroin use has increased rapidly across the U.S. and throughout society,” said CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden during a press conference. “With that increase we are seeing a dramatic rise in deaths.”

Addiction to prescription pain killers may be fueling some of the rise in heroin use. As TIME has reported, people who are addicted to painkillers may make the switch to heroin since it’s cheaper, doesn’t require a prescription, and offers a similar high. According to the CDC, those who are addicted to prescription opioid painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin. “Most heroin users have a history of nonmedical use of prescription opioid pain relievers, and an increase in the rate of heroin overdose deaths has occurred concurrently with an epidemic of prescription opioid overdoses,” the study authors write.

The report also shows that Americans using heroin are likely to be using other drugs. People addicted to cocaine are also 15 times more likely to be addicted to heroin. And the latest data shows that 96% of people who used heroin in the last year reported using at least one other drug during the same period, with 61% reporting they used at least three different drugs.

The CDC says comprehensive interventions need to happen at the federal and state levels, and health care providers need to follow best practices prescribe pain killers responsibly. As part of that effort, the government is increasing access to substance abuse treatment under the Affordable Care Act and increasing education and training for providers. States can address the problem by implementing prescription drug monitoring programs and expanding access to opioid overdose antidote naloxone, the CDC says.

Venmo, which is popular with the millennial generation, lets people link their debit and credit card accounts online and digitally transfer money to anyone. People often use the service to settle up after a night out on the town with friends or when splitting the cost of a gift, replacing payments made through check or cash. PayPal acquired Venmo through its $800 million acquisition of payments processing startup Braintree in 2013.

Transferring money through Venmo is free in the U.S. if the person who is paying draws the money from a bank account. If drawing from a credit card, that person is charged 2.9% of the amount transferred.

Venmo has seen its usage and volume multiply in the past year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Venmo handled $2.5 billion in payment volume, up 174% from the same quarter in 2014. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has said that the average Venmo user sends money through the app several times weekly.

He was wanted for allegedly organising the boat on which crew say they were paid more than $US30,000 by Australian officials to turn back from heading to New Zealand in May last year. It is understood he did not receive any of the money paid by Australian authorities.

""That one call ... that piece of the puzzle, may be the piece that may save a life,"" Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said.

There has been an almost 40 per cent increase in domestic-violence related deaths in NSW in 2016 compared with the same time last year.

""These are more than just statistics - these are peoples lives,"" Mr Scipione told reporters on Tuesday.

""As a state, as a community - we can do better than that.""

In 60 per cent of those cases, police have had no contact with the victim.

To try and close that gap, police have launched 'No Innocent Bystanders' just days before Friday's White Ribbon day, urging anyone who may witness or suspect domestic violence to call Crime Stoppers.

It is the first time bystanders have been targeted, Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence Pru Goward said.

Bystanders often fear that reporting domestic violence may make them a target, which is why the campaign uses the anonymous Crime Stoppers call line, she said.

The focus of the push will be two videos showing friends and neighbours picking up the phone when they hear or see something suspicious.

Ms Goward said community attitudes to domestic violence remained a problem and called for change.

""If this was your neighbour's car being vandalised you'd pick up the phone without a moment's hesitation - this is no different,"" Ms Goward said.

351,"One of four Victorians involved in a heroin trafficking ring has had his jail term cut following appeals.

Centre of the trafficking supply chain, Linh Anh Trinh, failed in her appeal bid on Friday, along with her sister Thuy Hoang Trinh, after both were jailed for the 2014 trafficking.

Linh Anh Trinh had been jailed for a maximum seven-and-a-half years for trafficking a large commercial quantity of heroin.

She sourced heroin from interstate, had it couriered from Sydney to Melbourne and arranged for it to be broken down and sold.

She appealed, arguing a co-offender who trafficked a greater amount of heroin over a longer period, got less jail time.

But the Court of Appeal noted ""considerable"" differences between the two offenders.

Her sister Thuy Hoang Trinh was jailed for a maximum five years for couriering the drugs, but the appeal judges found an error the sentencing judge made did not warrant a less jail time.

The Court of Appeal also dismissed a Director of Public Prosecutions appeal for Uyen Thi Phuong Thai, who packaged the drugs for on-sale.

The judges ruled it was open to the sentencing judge to hand down a merciful sentence in this case.

She was sole parent to an 11 year old with an autistic spectrum disorder, and the child had to be put into foster care because there was no one else to look after her.

The only appeal allowed was Minh Triet Nguyen's.

He had his maximum six-year jail term for trafficking a large commercial quantity of heroin slashed by six months.

352,"A spike in the number of women fleeing violent relationships around Christmas is putting pressure on community legal centres and it's feared women won't be able to access the support needed if funding cuts go ahead next year.

The National Association of Community Legal Services says demand is growing generally, and the additional pressure the holiday season brings highlights the stress services will come under if the federal government delivers its promise to slash funds.

NACLC spokesman Dan Stubbs said community legal centres already run on the smell of an oily rag.

""We do see a lot of family break-ups and unfortunately a spike in family violence this time of year,"" Mr Stubbs said.

""We need to be able to respond quickly to that.""

Between 2017/2018 and 2019/2020, Community Legal Centres will lose almost $35 million, the NACLC says.

Mr Stubbs said the services are facing growing demand around family violence generally.

353,"McDonald’s MCD is going to dramatically simplify its menu next month as a major part of its strategy to halt a U.S. sales slide that has gotten worse of late.

McDonald’s USA president Mike Andres said on Wednesday at an analyst meeting in Oak Brook, Ill., that the world’s largest restaurant company would remove eight items altogether from its menu and would only offer 11 extra value meals, rather than 16, to address a chronic criticism customers and investors alike have lobbed at it: service that is bogged down as workers struggle with learning and preparing too many menu items.

Earlier this week, McDonald’s reported that U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 4.6% in November, its worst decline in 14 years, continuing a streak of 14 months without growth. And the U.S. was not its only weak market- comparable sales were down 2.2% globally last month.

As Fortune reported last month in an article detailing McDonald’s chronic problems, the restaurant’s menu has 121 items today, a 75% increase from 2004, citing industry consultant Aaron Allen.

The pared-down menu is part of what Andres, who returned to McDonald’s in August to stem the U.S. sales slide, called the chain’s effort to regain its “burger leadership.” And the idea is for McDonald’s to be more nimble to changes in customer habits.

While neither Andres, nor his boss, CEO Don Thompson, were specific about what would be cut, Thompson noted that items like the McWrap sandwich take a lot of time to make. He also said that he could pare permutations of a same item.

The pressure is on Thompson, two years into his tenure, to show McDonald’s can revitalize a hamburger giant seen as passé by many customers in an era that has seen the ascendance of Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG and Panera Bread PNRA . McDonald’s has also been bested by rivals Wendy’s WEN and Burger King BKW in terms of sales growth.

Andres conceded that McDonald’s problems were such that the company had to move decisively.

“We are not going to re-energize this business by taking incremental steps,” Andres said.

McDonald’s has had trouble weaning customers off of its inexpensive Dollar Menus, something that deepened the price disparity between its lower price items and its premium offerings, and damaged the overall image of the restaurant, said Andres, who started at McDonald’s 32 years ago, with a short interruption as CEO of Logan’s Roadhouse steak and burger chain. He returned to McDonald’s in October.

As part of its turnaround efforts, McDonald’s is currently testing “Create Your Taste,” which allows customers to personalize their burger, a key part of fixing McDonald’s image problem. But it has its work cut out for it: a reader poll by product testing organization Consumer Reports released in July found McDonalds burgers ranked as the worst in the U.S.

Andres also wants to enhance McDonald’s offering by being “more culinary inspired” and having items with shorter ingredient labels.

But either way, Andres and Thompson tacitly acknowledged long-time criticisms of the company and practically sounded the alarm to make it clear the company needs to move decisively.

“The pace of change outside of McDonald’s has become faster than perhaps the pace of change internally,” Andres said.","McDonald's is removing items from its menu and offering fewer value meals as it looks to speed up service, win back customers and halt a chronic U.S. sales slide.",Generated Summary: McDonald’s MCD is going to dramatically simplify its menu next month as a major part of its strategy to halt a U.S. sales slide that has gotten worse of late.
354,"Google said Monday that it has taken another big step forward in developing self-driving cars by building a fully functioning prototype of its own design.

“Today we’re unwrapping the best holiday gift we could’ve imagined: the first real build of our self-driving vehicle prototype,” Google said in a blog post.

Google unveiled its latest model – a tiny two-passenger car – in May, generating worldwide buzz. But on Monday, the company admitted that it was just a mock-up that lacked much of what you’d expect in a car.

“It didn’t even have real headlights!” Google said.

Google has said that its car would be built without a steering wheel, gas pedals and brakes, which are, in theory, unnecessary because passengers can just sit back and relax while technology handles the steering. To drive on public streets in California, however, Google must install traditional controls, just in case a human driver needs to take over.

Google GOOG plans to build about 100 prototype cars and test them for the next few years, the company said.

Previously, Google’s tests of the futuristic technology involved modified Toyota Priuses and Lexus SUVs. Over the past few years, the company had logged hundreds of thousands of miles in such cars on public roads.

Since showing off the mock up in May, Google has been hard at work on coming up with new prototype. The process involved using different versions to test individual car components that handle the steering and braking along with the computers and sensors required for autonomous driving technology.

“We’re going to be spending the holidays zipping around our test track, and we hope to see you on the streets of Northern California in the new year,” the company said.

As of last month, seven companies including Mercedes-Benz, Nissan and Tesla have received permits to test self-driving cars on public roads in California, making it a hotbed for the technology.",The tech giant in-house design for the futuristic autonomous technology is now fully functional.,Generated Summary: Google said Monday that it has taken another big step forward in developing self-driving cars by building a fully functioning prototype of its own design.

While in other circumstances that might be a worrisome sign, now it might actually be a positive indicator, said Anand Sanwal, CB Insights CEO and co-founder.

Traditionally, corporate VCs have been known as the ""dumb money"" since they tend to follow at the tail end of trends rather than anticipate them.

But as more traditional investors have been shy about investing in start-ups, corporate VCs have filled an important void, said Sanwal.

During the first quarter, 83 corporate venture capitalist groups completed an investment for a total of $3.01 billion across 129 deals, according to research published Thursday by CB Insights. That's more than double the amount of money corporate VCs invested during the same quarter last year.

In fact, corporate VC funding accounted for 30 percent of the $9.99 billion in total VC dollars that were invested during the first quarter, which was the biggest quarter for VC funding since the second quarter of 2001.

Corporations are now investing in 4 out of 10 of the largest tech deals and the rate of their participation continues to grow, Sanwal said.

359,"Scientists are getting closer to creating a real-life invisibility cloak.

A new study published in the journal Science shows scientists have created what they are calling a “ultrathin invisibility skin cloak for visible light.” The cloak has been shown to cover an object and—by manipulating certain wavelengths of light—render it invisible.

Light plays a central role in how we see objects. According to the Los Angeles Times, usually light bounces off of things and becomes distorted, which helps a person see the angles and curves of an object. However, the LA Times writes that the cloak is covered with “nanoantennas made of tiny gold blocks of different sizes that can counteract that distortion, making it seem to an observer like the light is coming from a flat surface.”

The cloak is 80 nanometers thick, which is a bonus since the study authors say prior attempts have been too bulky and therefore difficult to scale up. Still, the current cloak only covers a very tiny object, so there’s a long way to go before people can make themselves invisible or hard to see.

Other research teams are also looking into the creation of an invisibility cloak. In early July, University of California, San Diego researchers designed their own early version. “Invisibility may seem like magic at first, but its underlying concepts are familiar to everyone. All it requires is a clever manipulation of our perception,” Boubacar Kanté, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering said in a statement about his work. “Full invisibility still seems beyond reach today, but it might become a reality in the near future thanks to recent progress in cloaking devices.”",Some small breakthroughs are slowly moving the science forward,Generated Summary: Scientists are getting closer to creating a real-life invisibility cloak.

The Labor government will give Foodbank NT $1.4 million over five years, giving the hunger relief agency the certainty to help the needy during the festive season.

The organisation provided 280,000 meals in 2015, but was in danger of closing its doors earlier this year because of a funding shortfall.

Chief Minister Michael Gunner said families come under greater pressure around Christmas, and this year 600 hampers have been packed for Territorians doing it tough over the holiday period.

""I know just what it is like to have to rely on organisations like these to put food on the family table,"" he said.

Mr Gunner said Foodbank is also a crucial service at this time of the year when emergencies, including floods and cyclones, ramp up in the Territory.

""Foodbank are there when people need it, we saw that last year with the Daly River floods,"" he said.

The charity gets food donations and volunteers, but it'll use the cash to pay for things like rent and electricity.

""Bills come, and unfortunately Power and Water (Corporation) don't take cans of soup in payment,"" Mr Gunner said.

The annual $280,000 in funding will start flowing this financial year.

The previous CLP government had pledged $20,000 less annually, and only for three years.

361,"Harvard University has selected insider Stephen Blyth, an investment manager with a focus on mathematical analysis, to lead the world’s largest endowment.

Blyth, who takes over the top job Jan. 1, holds a PhD in statistics from Harvard and recently wrote a book on quantitative finance. But he came up through the trading ranks on Wall Street and says he prefers to think of himself as “an investor first.’’

The board of the $36.4 billion endowment conducted a national search to find a replacement for chief executive Jane Mendillo, who is stepping down after six years. They picked one of Mendillo’s top lieutenants, who weathered the financial crisis and its aftermath with her.

RELATED: Harvard endowment posts 15.4 percent gain

“Jane was outstanding during that time,’’ said Blyth, a native of North London who turns 47 this weekend. “I can’t imagine a better leader.”

Blyth joined the university’s investment arm, Harvard Management Co., in 2006 to build its bond team, which has performed well for the endowment. After Mendillo arrived in 2008, his portfolio grew and he was tasked with overseeing all the internal money managers at Harvard Management. In 2012, he was named managing director and head of public markets, overseeing managers inside Harvard as well as outside funds and firms hired by the endowment.

In a statement, Mendillo said she “can’t imagine a better choice to lead [the endowment] into the future. He has proven himself a talented and successful investor and a strong and effective leader.”

Blyth said he is on the same page as Mendillo on the way she has repositioned the portfolio since the financial crisis. “I feel we’re well-positioned now. I feel I’m inheriting a strong organization,’’ Blyth said.

But there is unspoken pressure to boost returns. Mendillo’s tenure was marked largely by unwinding risk and dumping bad investments, while moving into areas where she saw greater potential, such as direct real estate investments.

Six years later, her numbers are in the middle of the pack — but not stellar, as the Harvard community and investment peers had come to expect.

On Tuesday, Harvard issued the final annual performance report of Mendillo’s tenure. The fund posted a gain of 15.4 percent during the fiscal year ended June 30, slightly below the 16.1 percent median for comparable endowments.

On Wednesday, Harvard’s chief rivals posted better returns: 20.2 percent for Yale University and 17 percent for Stanford University.

Mendillo’s five-year average annual return was 11.6 percent. That matches the median five-year return for educational endowments tracked by the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service.

Blyth would not say whether he was under the gun to produce stronger results. Harvard depends on cash from the endowment to cover 36 percent of its annual budget.

“I’m looking to build on that performance, and I’m looking to build on the portfolio that Jane has put in place,’’ he said.

Mendillo made a mark during her time at the helm by providing a steady hand during a difficult period and by forging closer relations with the university itself. It is a role that her predecessors did not always embrace, miles from the Cambridge campus in Harvard Management’s perch at the Federal Reserve tower in downtown Boston.

In navigating those relationships, Blyth can lean on his own academic experience. He has taught mathematics in the past at Imperial College London and in recent years has taught statistics at Harvard.

Blyth said his job won’t leave him time to teach this year.

Further to that, they are high in potassium, vitamin A and calcium. Who would have thought that you could find so much goodness in one humble berry?

It has been suggested that drinking raspberry leaf tea shortens the second stage of labour.

It's famous for its raspberry growing. In the late 1950s, raspberries were brought down from Scotland to London on a steam train known as the Raspberry Special.

They are thought to been eaten since prehistoric times, but only began to be cultivated in England and France in about the 1600s.

That's a bit more than your standard pink berries in a box at Waitrose, isn't it?

Not all at once, but raspberries can be red, purple, gold or black in colour. The gold ones are the sweetest variety, and very tasty.

Golden raspberries are super sweet and tasty (Clara Molden)

To form new species, raspberries have been crossed with other berries.

The loganberry is a cross between raspberries and blackberries; the boysenberry is a cross between red raspberries, blackberries and loganberries; the nessberry is a cross between a dewberry, raspberry and a blackberry.

It's all gone a bit meta-berry.

Not like the football scores, no. Aggregate fruits have flowers with multiple ovaries and each produces druplets around a core.

Those druplets are the delicate little bead-like pockets of goodness in each raspberry, and each one could be considered a separate fruit on its own.

In a nice way, though: an average raspberry has 100 to 120 seeds.

The loganberry is a relative of the raspberry (PhotoLibrary)

No, you wouldn't have thought it, would you. In some kinds of Christian art, the raspberry is the symbol for kindness. The red juice was thought of as the blood running through the heart, where kindness originates.

In the Philippines, if you hang a raspberry cane from the outside of your house, evil spirits are supposed to be deterred.

In Germany, too, raspberry canes would be tied to the horse's body in the belief that it would calm them down. So much power in one gentle cane!

In the past they have been used to clean the teeth, and as a cure for sore eyes.

366,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has received his first un-endorsement as the firestorm expands over his racially-focused attacks on a federal judge.

Sen. Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, released a statement Tuesday saying that Trump lacks “the temperament” necessary for the Oval Office.

“After much consideration, I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world,” Kirk said in a statement.

The presidential campaign: Donald Trump

Kirk is running for re-election in what is considered one of the most contested races in the country.

Before Trump earned the nomination, Kirk said that he “certainly would” support him if he won the nomination.

But Trump’s latest attacks against Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing a suit against Trump University, is a bridge too far, Kirk says.

“As the Presidential campaign progressed, I was hoping the rhetoric would tone down and reflect a campaign that was inclusive, thoughtful and principled. While I oppose the Democratic nominee, Donald Trump’s latest statements, in context with past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that I cannnot and will not support my party’s nominee for President regardless of the political impact on my candidacy or the Republican Party.”

While Kirk is the first candidate to take back his support, he is one of more than a dozens of Republican leaders who have denounced Trump’s latest comments against Curiel.

On Tuesday alone, the top Republican in Congress had harsh words for Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan called them “the textbook definition of a racist comment” and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advised Trump to “stop attacking … various minority groups … and get on message.”

368,"A rebound in national income suggests Treasurer Scott Morrison will be able to report an improved budget bottom line when he hands down his mid-year review in December.

New figures show Australia's terms of trade grew for a second quarter in a row, after several years of decline in the post-mining boom era.

Export prices grew 3.5 per cent in the September quarter, the fastest growth in three years, and building on the 1.4 per cent increase in the previous three months.

Import prices fell for a fourth straight quarter, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data released on Thursday.

""If export prices are outpacing the price of imports, this indicates a broad-based lift to incomes in Australia,"" Commonwealth Securities chief economist Craig James said.

He estimates the terms of trade grew around 4.5 per cent, the biggest quarterly gain in five years.

The terms of trade was predicted to rise by just 1.25 per cent in 2016/17 in the May budget, albeit coming off a 10.2 per cent drop in 2015/16.

It would be a further reason for the Reserve Bank to leave the cash rate unchanged at a record low 1.5 per cent at next Tuesday's Reserve Bank board meeting.

Wednesday's official inflation figures proved slightly more upbeat than expected, dampening the need for another rate cut for now.

JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said the performance of Australia's key commodity export markets suggests the terms of trade is likely to climb further in the December quarter.

""Spot coal prices have moved sharply higher since late September,"" he said.

""Given the preference of exporters to operate on quarterly contracts, it appears these gains are now partly crystalised from a terms of trade point of view.""

Iron ore prices have also firmed.

The government's most recent monthly financial statement for September showed the budget deficit running at $20.9 billion after the first three months of the financial year, $1.9 billion smaller than had been predicted at this stage of the year.

The full-year deficit for 2016/17 was forecast at $37.1 billion in the budget.","The nation's terms of trade grew at the fastest pace in five years in the September quarter, buoyed by a surge in key commodity export prices.",Generated Summary: A rebound in national income suggests Treasurer Scott Morrison will be able to report an improved budget bottom line when he hands down his mid-year review in December.
369,"Kinder Morgan Inc. KMI said Sunday it will bring all the assets of its sprawling empire of oil and gas pipelines and storage under one roof in a sweeping reorganization that will create an energy giant worth $44 billion.

The company, which owns 80,000 miles of pipelines and 180 storage facilities across the U.S., said on its website it will offer minority shareholders in its three affiliated holding companies $4 billion in cash and about $40 billion in new shares in Kinder Morgan Inc. that will be publicly traded, effectively scrapping the tax-efficient structures known as “Master Limited Partnerships” that it has used to spectacular effect in exploiting the U.S.’s energy boom.

The deal is the second-largest in the history of the energy sector, after Exxon’s acqusition of Mobil in 1999. In large measure, it’s a response to concerns that the company had outgrown the Master Limited Partnership model, and needed to simplify its financial and organizational structure to carry on growing. Unifying the share structure will enable the company to use its stock as an acquisition currency, while the creation of a single company will enhance the quality of its debt, bringing down borrowing costs.

The combined company will assume around $27 billion in debt held by the individual partnerships, bringing the total transaction value to over $70 billion.Kinder Morgan said that it had talked to credit ratings agencies ahead of the deal and expects its debt to be classed as investment grade.

“In the opportunity-rich environment of today’s energy infrastructure sector, we believe this transaction gives us the ability to grow KMI for years to come,” Chairman and chief executive Richard D. Kinder said in a statement.

The minority shareholders in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. KMP , Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR and El Paso Pipeline Partners L.P. EPC will receive a premium of 11%, 16.5% and 15.4% on Friday’s closing prices, respectively, for their shares.

370,"Gilbane Building Co. , the Providence company that oversaw the construction of a $302 million mental hospital in Worcester that was completed in 2012, bears less responsibility than the state charged for design flaws that resulted in cost overruns, according to the state’s top court.

In a case that contractors warned could result in higher prices for the construction of public buildings, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled Wednesday that Gilbane wasn’t wholly responsible for an error in the hospital’s plans that allegedly caused at least $5 million in extra costs. The case was sent back to a lower court for further arguments.

Gilbane was the construction-manager-at-risk on the project, a role that gave it some influence in the design process. Many public works projects are designed by architects before construction firms bid on the job, but Massachusetts and local authorities have increasingly turned to construction-managers-at-risk to cut down on time-consuming blueprint modifications and disputes.

Since 2005, local authorities have commissioned more than $5.3 billion in public works that rely on the construction-manager-at-risk method, according to the state inspector general’s office. State agencies have commissioned untold amounts more.

The method can’t legally be used for some projects, such as the Green Line Extension, according to a MassDOT presentation. But David Hatem, an attorney who frequently represents designers on public works projects and filed a brief in the case, said the ruling addressed similar questions of who bears the risks of big construction projects — contractors or taxpayers.

“You’re dealing with the same legal issues,” Hatem said. “I think it’s an extraordinarily thoughtful decision. It’s well-balanced.”

Trade bodies representing architects and engineers argued the Supreme Judicial Court should rule against Gilbane, saying the law was written so the builder would bear the risk of cost overruns. A group of general contractors asked the court to rule otherwise, and warned that a negative outcome would require construction managers to charge more for public projects, raising costs for taxpayers to offset that risk.

John W. DiNicola II, a partner at DiNicola Seligson & Upton who represented Gilbane and its insurer in the appeal, said the court “accepted basically all of our arguments.” The state’s Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance said it viewed the outcome as nothing more than a procedural move, however.

“DCAMM is confident that it will prevail at trial,” said Brendan Moss, a spokesman for the division.

372,"James ""Whitey"" Bulger, one of America's most notorious underworld bosses, has been convicted of nearly a dozen murders, racketeering and conspiracy.

The 83-year-old terrorised an Irish-Catholic neighbourhood of Boston in the 1970s and '80s as leader of the Winter Hill Gang.

He betrayed no emotion upon hearing the verdict after a two-month trial.

Bulger went on the run in 1994 and was finally captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011.

He was said to have been an inspiration for the gangster played by Jack Nicholson in Oscar-winning 2006 film The Departed.

The trial in Boston heard gruesome evidence that Bulger had participated in 19 murders, but he was found guilty on Monday of a role in only 11 of them.

Convicted of 31 of the 32 total criminal counts against him, Bulger faces a life prison sentence. But analysts have pointed out that even a short sentence would likely see the stooped, grey-haired ex-gangster die in prison.

Bulger refused to testify at the trial, calling the proceedings ""a sham"" because he said he had been promised immunity by a now-deceased prosecutor in return for protection from other mobsters.

During the trial, the federal jury of 12 heard testimony from 72 witnesses and saw 840 exhibits

Prosecutors said Bulger had been a longtime FBI informant protected by corrupt agents, who turned a blind eye to the Winter Hill Gang's activities in return for information on the Italian Mafia.

Bulger's victims included anyone he saw as a threat, prosecutors said, including innocent people in the wrong place at the wrong time.

""This is not some Robin Hood story about a guy who kept angel dust and heroin out of Southie,"" prosecutor Fred Wyshak told the jury in closing arguments, referring to the South Boston neighbourhood that was his gang's turf.

Bulger's former associates testified against him, saying he threatened anyone who could expose his crime syndicate, and threatened others with pistols and machine guns to force them to hand over cash.

Among other things, he was accused of strangling two women with his bare hands, shooting two chained men in the head after interrogating them for hours, and opening fire on two others as they left a South Boston restaurant.

One witness, real estate developer Richard Buccheri, said the mob boss threatened to kill him and his family if he did not pay $200,000 (£130,000), sticking a shotgun in Mr Buccheri's mouth.

The defence did not contest accusations Bulger ran a criminal enterprise, but strongly denied he killed the women and that he was ""rat"" - an informant against others in the criminal underworld.

Defence lawyers sought to portray the key witnesses, all convicted mob members, as pathological liars who were attempting to pin their own crimes on Bulger.

""Today is a day many in this city thought would never come,"" Massachusetts US Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a press conference after the verdict, which she said marked the end of an ""ugly"" era in Boston's history.

""Despite the corruption, we stand here today because of the dogged work of honest and dedicated members of law enforcement.""

Bulger was featured on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list for 16 years until he was found living in California with his girlfriend Catherine Greig.

She was sentenced in 2012 to eight years in prison for helping Bulger evade the law.

He fled Boston in 1994 after a retired FBI agent tipped him off that he was about to be indicted.

His origins in a Boston housing estate, his career in the criminal underworld, and his years on the run from the law captivated the city, especially as his younger brother William rose to become president of the state Senate.

Bulger's disappearance was a major embarrassment for the FBI, especially after it was alleged in court that he and his gang paid off several FBI agents and state and Boston police officers, offering cash and cases of fine wine in exchange for information on search warrants and wiretaps.","James ""Whitey"" Bulger, one of America's most notorious underworld bosses, is convicted of nearly a dozen murders, racketeering and conspiracy.","Generated Summary: James ""Whitey"" Bulger, one of America's most notorious underworld bosses, has been convicted of nearly a dozen murders, racketeering and conspiracy."

375,"Authorities say a police officer has been shot in Ferguson, Missouri, the scene of racial unrest in the wake of the August shooting death of a black 18-year-old by a white police officer.

Tim Zoll of the Ferguson Police Department told KSDK-TV that the officer was shot in the arm.

St Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman told The Associated Press that an officer was shot but said he had no further information.

The circumstances surrounding the shooting were not immediately clear.

The city has been the scene of unrest since the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old, by a white police officer.

The shooting on Saturday comes after Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson issued a videotaped apology earlier in the week and attempted to march with protesters, an effort that led to a clash with activists and several arrests on Thursday.

Messages left with Jackson and spokesmen on Saturday night were not immediately returned.

A county grand jury is weighing whether to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson in Brown's shooting.

The Justice Department, which is investigating whether Brown's civil rights were violated, is conducting a broader probe into Ferguson police.

On Friday, it urged Jackson to ban his officers from wearing bracelets supporting Wilson while on duty and from covering up their name plates with black tape.

Ferguson residents complained about the bracelets, which are black with ""I am Darren Wilson"" in white lettering, at a meeting with federal officials this week.

376,"Family Dollar’s shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a $8.5 billion takeover bid by rival discount chain Dollar Tree, a vote that sidelines Dollar General’s competing offer.

At the vote held in North Carolina, investors holding 74% of Family Dollar’s total outstanding shares voted in favor of the proposal, an outcome that Chairman and CEO Howard Levine praised. The merger still requires approval from the Federal Trade Commission, and that could come as soon as March.

The discount-retail sector has been the subject of a complicated and drawn out love triangle that has made headlines since July, when Dollar Tree DLTR initially made a play for Family Dollar in a cash-and-stock deal. But rival Dollar General swooped in with a competing offer, saying it would pay $80 per share for Family Dollar FDO while Dollar Tree has stuck with its original $74.50 cash-and-stock offer.

While the Dollar General DG offer guarantees a higher price paid to shareholders, the vote ultimately asked investors to consider the growth potential of a merged Family Dollar-Dollar Tree (if they are willing to stick with their investment) over the long term.

Dollar Tree also lauded the outcome, while Dollar General was unsurprisingly disappointed.

“Today’s vote is a loss not only for Family Dollar shareholders, but also for consumers across the country who will not have the opportunity to benefit from the cost savings and efficiencies that we believe would have been created by a merger between Dollar General and Family Dollar,” said Rick Dreiling, Dollar General’s CEO and chairman.

The Dollar Tree bid also comes with fewer headaches, as the merged company would need to unload far fewer stores than if Dollar General had been successful, with divestitures needed from both proposals to win backing from the FTC.

Investors were finally persuaded the Dollar Tree deal was the right course to pursue. The Family Dollar vote had been postponed at one point because there hadn’t been enough votes to adopt the Dollar Tree merger, which Family Dollar has backed since the beginning. Since then, two influential shareholder advisory firms — Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis — have thrown their support behind the Dollar Tree bid.

Dollar Tree’s offer was a roughly 23% premium over Family Dollar’s trading price at the time the offer was officially made. The combined company will generate annual sales of about $18 billion, putting it slightly above Dollar General and making it a larger rival to Wal-Mart WMT and other stores that sell goods at low prices. Dollar Tree sells everything in its stores for $1 or less, while Family Dollar has multiple price points to court value-conscious shoppers.

While the Family Dollar winner had remained in doubt for months, one clear winner was activist investor Carl Icahn. Icahn last year called on Family Dollar to put itself up for sale immediately, and at one point held a 9.4% stake in the company. He scored a reported $200 million profit on his investment when a bidding war broke out shortly after he lamented the retailer’s underperformance.",The vote sidelines Dollar General's competing offer.,"Generated Summary: Family Dollar’s shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a $8.5 billion takeover bid by rival discount chain Dollar General’s shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a $8.5 billion takeover bid by rival discount chain Dollar Tree, a vote that sidelines Dollar General’s competing offer."

378,"A deal with world powers ended a ""manufactured crisis"" over Iran's nuclear program, its foreign minister says, as he arrived home from negotiating the agreement that has angered US lawmakers.

As attention turned to the lengthy process of implementing the complex accord, Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday the world had no cause to fear Iran's nuclear activities.

Zarif, who led Iran's negotiating team in the 18 straight days of ""tough"" talks that culminated in Tuesday's historic agreement, said common ground had been found.

""We will take measures and they will do their part,"" he told reporters at Tehran's Mehrabad airport, referring to the six powers led by the United States with whom Iran is now bonded in the nuclear pact.

""It will happen in around four months from now,"" he said of the formal implementation of the deal.

Zarif's comments came after a night of celebrations in Tehran where his own name was chanted in the streets by joyous Iranians.

Many festooned their cars with balloons and danced on the street to celebrate the prospect of an end to the long years of economic hardship caused by Western sanctions.

But only hours earlier in Washington, the deal came under intense scrutiny.

The speaker of the Republican-led US House of Representatives, John Boehner, said the agreement was ""likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world"".

Zarif hit back at the deal's biggest critic, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the region's sole if undeclared nuclear state, who branded the agreement a ""historic mistake"".

""Netanyahu kicked up a fuss as he is upset that Iran managed to get sanctions lifted and prevent a manufactured crisis,"" Zarif said.

Iran has always denied seeking an atomic bomb and that stance was reiterated by President Hassan Rouhani after Tuesday's agreement.

Soon after the deal was announced, the White House launched a campaign to stop sceptics at home and abroad from derailing the hard-won accord.

US President Barack Obama was to hold a press conference later on Wednesday to try to convince Americans of the benefits of the deal, which is likely to face a bruising passage through congress.

US lawmakers have 60 days to review the accord, but Obama has vowed to use his presidential veto over any attempt to block it.

Obama said the accord meant ""every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off"".

""This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it,"" he said, pointing to a broader effort to end the hostility between the two governments that has persisted ever since the overthrow of the US-backed shah in the Islamic revolution of 1979.

Washington hopes the accord may lead to more co-operation with Iran at an explosive time in the Middle East after the Islamic State militant group surged last year, seizing vast swathes of Syria and Iraq.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the deal paves the way for a ""broad"" coalition to fight the Sunni extremist group which is as hostile to Shi'ite Iran as it is to the West.

""It removes the barriers - largely artificial - on the way to a broad coalition to fight the Islamic State and other terrorist groups,"" Lavrov said.

EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told Sky Italia the deal ""opens the way for a new confidence"" in combating IS.

But it has alarmed some of America's most important Middle East allies, including Sunni regional power Saudi Arabia.

""A punitive action was carried out ... in revenge for the massacre in Suruc,"" the People's Defence Forces (HPG) said in a statement on its website on Wednesday, accusing the two officers of cooperating with the Islamic State jihadists who are believed to have carried out the attack.

The two police officers were found shot dead at their home in the town of Ceylanpinar on the border with Syria, two days after the Suruc suicide attack, that left 32 people dead.

The statement by the HPG said that the attack took place at 6:00 am (1300 AEST) and that the police officers' identity cards and service weapons had been seized.

The attack on the police risks further ratcheting up tensions in Turkey after the Suruc suicide bombing, bringing the battle between Kurds and IS that is raging inside Syria onto Turkish territory.

The authorities had earlier appeared at a loss to explain the attack on the police in Ceylanpinar, which had been first announced earlier on Wednesday.

Turkish television quoted the governor of Sanliurfa region, Izzettin Kucuk, as saying earlier it was not immediately clear if the attack had ""terrorist connections"".

The PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency for self-rule that claimed tens of thousands of lives.

It declared a truce in 2013 after the government opened secret peace negotiations with Ocalan.

However Kurds have become increasingly frustrated with the government's policy on Syria, as Ankara refuses to support the Kurdish groups fighting IS jihadists inside Syria.

Kurds, widely seen as the world's largest group of stateless people, are Turkey's largest minority and the main group in the southeast of the country.

385,"There's never been a better time to be a wealthy retiree enjoying generous tax breaks that past generations didn't get, a prominent think-tank says.

But it's at a time when Australia can least afford it and it's prompted the Grattan Institute to call for a clamp down on tax incentives for seniors.

The Melbourne-based institute has found the government could gain $1 billion a year by winding back the seniors and pensioners tax offset and Medicare levy income threshold.

The private health insurance rebate would also be reduced to the same level as younger workers with similar incomes.

Only age pensioners would qualify for the offset but those with enough private income would pay the tax.

The think-tank says those tax breaks are a relatively new concept which predecessors didn't get.

Today's retirees receive much more in government spending even with more income and assets.

The rise of the ""taxed-nots"" was partly because of increases to age-based tax breaks.

""This older generation is taking way more out of the piggy bank than previous generations because their health costs are much higher,"" Grattan chief executive John Daley told AAP.

Mr Daley concedes change will be politically difficult given the higher proportion of older voters.

But such reforms had to be part of the solution given Australia was facing a budget problem.

""Someone's going to have to pay that back,"" he said.

""Younger households are going to have to pay, at some stage, an extra $10,000 in tax every time we run a budget deficit of $40 billion.""",The federal government is being urged to abolish generous tax breaks for wealthy retirees in order to gain $1 billion a year in revenue.,"Generated Summary: There's never been a better time to be a better time to be a wealthy retiree enjoying generous tax breaks that past generations didn't get, a prominent think-tank says."

""Current conditions in the overall economy were reported by consumers to have recently weakened,"" survey director Richard Curtin said.

A combination of bad weather, a slow pace of inventory accumulation by businesses, the expiration of long-term unemployment benefits and cuts to food stamps is expected to hold back economic growth to an annualized pace of around 2 percent in the first quarter.

But a rebound is expected as these factors fade. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter.

U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested remarks by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang that his government was ready to support China's cooling economy.

U.S. consumer spending in February was lifted by an increase in services consumption, likely because of increased demand for health care and utilities. When adjusted for inflation, spending rose 0.2 percent. January's real consumer spending was, however, revised to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of a 0.3 percent jump.

This measure goes into the calculation of gross domestic product, and January's revision suggested consumer spending cooled this quarter after logging its fastest pace in three years in the final three months of 2013.","Consumer sentiment fell as consumers were less hopeful about the prospects for the overall economy, a survey showed.",Generated Summary: U.

Nevertheless, the data has not dented expectations for further monetary easing in the coming months.

Exports jumped 9.9 percent from the year-ago period, official data showed on Tuesday, much better than Reuters expectations for a 6.8 percent increase and after climbing 4.7 percent in November.

Imports fell an annual 2.3 percent, narrower than a forecast drop of 7.4 percent and following November's 6.7 percent decline.

This brought the trade surplus to $49.1 billion, compared with $49.85 billion expected and a $54.47 billion print in November.

The Australian dollar, which is highly-sensitive to Chinese data, edged up to $0.8175 from $0.8170 on the news.

""The data shows the resilience of Chinese exports in the face of soft global demand – and this is positive because China still relies heavily on foreign markets for generating economic growth,"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist at Credit Agricole told CNBC.

""But, we still think the data is consistent with the need to ease policy in order to achieve stronger domestic demand,"" he added.

While the data lessens the urgency for the People's Bank of China to act, Kowalczyk expects the central bank will cut both interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by the end of the first quarter. He sees a second RRR cut in the second quarter.

388,"An Australian family who answered a call to move to the remote Scottish Highlands hope the British Home Office will honour a deal to grant them a work visa after the rules were switched on them.

Kathryn and Gregg Brain and their seven-year-old son Lachlan moved to Dingwall in 2011 as part of the Scottish government's Highland Homecoming plan, backed by the Home Office, to boost a shrinking population in Scotland's rural north.

But the following year the British government changed the rules, meaning the Brains would no longer be granted a two-year post-study work visa when Ms Brain finished her Scottish history studies on a student visa.

Unless granted a reprieve, the family must be out of the UK by next Tuesday.

But the family have some powerful lobbyists fighting on their behalf, including Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.

The Brains were in Edinburgh on Thursday to meet Ms Sturgeon, who has written to Home Secretary Theresa May asking her to let the family stay.

""The government changed the rules before these people had a chance to benefit. The wee boy is a Gaelic speaker and is, to all intents and purposes, Scottish,"" Ms Sturgeon said following the meeting.

The Brains were also awaiting the outcome of a meeting between their Scottish National Party MP Ian Blackford and British Immigration Minister James Brokenshire in London on Thursday.

Mr Blackford is asking that the Brains, who have Scottish ancestry, be granted the two-year work visa they expected to get when they sold their house in Australia to move to Scotland.

Ms Brain told AAP on Thursday that she and her husband, a health and safety expert, felt very let down when the rules were changed after they had adhered to every rule of the Highland Homecoming plan.

""It was a life-changing decision for us ... we uprooted our young family to move over here. You would think they would still honour the deal that was promised on that basis, just to act in good faith.""

Mr Brokenshire this week said the Brains faced no ""imminent risk of immediate deportation"" and they could apply for a Tier 2 skilled work visa.

""We will consider any application they make,"" the immigration minister said.

Ms Brain said an employer had offered her a job that fitted Tier 2 visa requirements but the paperwork took up to two months to process so they hoped they would be granted leave to stay at least that long.

She said ""all of Scotland and most of England"" appeared to be backing them and their case was raised in the British parliament on Thursday.

Mr Blackford told AAP before meeting Mr Brokenshire that the minister had to recognise he had to take away the family's fear of deportation and right a wrong created by a ""breach of trust"" by the government.

“At least 59 out of 80 who contracted Ebola across the West African country have died so far,” said UNICEF in a statement to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

There are no known treatments or vaccines for Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever that kills up to 90 percent of those who become infected, depending on the strain of the virus. The virus is spread through direct contact with blood, feces or sweat, by sexual contact or unprotected handling of contaminated corpses. First discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976, the disease has spread in several outbreaks, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.

“This outbreak is particularly devastating because medical staff are among the first victims … hindering the response and threatening normal care in a country already lacking in medical personnel,” UNICEF said.

The protest began peacefully, with about 200 Aboriginal people holding signs demanding justice for the 14-year-old and claiming the accused man should have been charged with murder rather than manslaughter.

But the protesters soon became unruly and began climbing over fences and police cars to get into the court complex, smashing glass doors.

Fox News queried the White House about its e-mail delivery system after the network reportedly

from people claiming they were sent unsolicited e-mails directly from the White House.

The complaints largely referred to a long e-mail

from White House adviser David Axelrod that promoted the president's health care reform agenda and sought to dispel ""myths"" about health care reform. Axelrod urged recipients of his e-mail to pass it on to others, but complaints to Fox News reportedly referred specifically to e-mails sent directly from the White House.

In a statement given Sunday night, the White House reportedly said it will change its e-mail sign-up procedures and indicated third party advocacy groups may have signed up individuals for the e-mail distribution list without their permission.

397,"Normally I refrain from writing about new products, but there were two significant introductions early this week that represent make-or-break moments for the companies behind them, SAP and VMware. Here’s what you need to know.

Once upon a time, SAP’s resource planning, supply chain software, and other business management applications relied on Oracle’s platform. Then, the latter company coveted those markets, too. The two have been drifting apart for years, but the ties were severed (once and for all?) this week with SAP’s latest, massive software overhaul. Now, businesses will have to run them using SAP’s own database technology, HANA. (That awkward acronym officially stands for High-Performance Analytic Appliance.)

The storyline is that HANA will help SAP’s applications run faster than ever. The company’s new buddy in this quest is IBM, which is host to the cloud edition. Considering the rather lukewarm reception for HANA so far, this is a pretty bold decision. CEO Bill McDermott is pretty confident.

“I don’t think a lot of people have fully comprehended that HANA is the de facto standard in-memory platform for OLAP and OLTP. And that is the only database in the world that can do transactions, analytics, and all the unstructured stuff like social. And it’s gonna blow everybody away. There’s no shot! We win this. We’re going to win this thing. And now we’re at the top of the hill cruising down.”

We won’t know the moral of this story for some time, but SAP is expecting the industry’s transition to cloud-delivered software to be a drag on its profits through 2017. So, the clock is ticking.

Virtual server software—which lets businesses consolidate under-utilized server hardware—used to be this company’s most important product. Moving forward, though, VMware VMW wants to convince more customers to invest in its vSphere data center management software.

The overhaul launched this week includes features directly competitive with products from EMC, which owns 80% of VMware’s stock. VMware’s updated mission: help control all of the components in their data center—including networking gear, data storage arrays, and computing servers—rather than just concentrating on the virtualized stuff. There’s also that little matter of being able to support the cloud services more companies are using to handle applications and processes.

Here’s the requisite proclamation from VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger: “Today, we are taking another leap forward in helping our customers meet these demands through a unified platform, defined in software, which will offer unmatched choice and extends out innovation across compute, networking and storage to deliver the hybrid cloud.”

Lots of buzzwords to sort. The key takeaway is that VMware needs to watch its back for innovators in software-defined networking and converged infrastructure. That’s especially true, given that EMC and Cisco, once close partners in this market, are now addressing it separately.

There are also many newcomers winning attention. One notable example is Nutanix, which disclosed Wednesday that it has now signed up 1,200 customers for technology that converges the functions of networking gear, storage devices, and servers. Reference accounts include Best Buy, eBay, Hyundai, and Staples. At least 50 of those organizations have bought more than $1 million worth of Nutanix gear.

For the second quarter (ended Jan. 31), Nutanix reports that its annualized bookings run rate topped $300 million. Hmmm. When privately held companies start publishing quarterly updates on sales, formal IPO plans often aren’t far behind. So far, Nutanix has raised about $312 million; its valuation is in the $2 billion zone.

Correction, Feb. 4, 2015: An earlier version of this article stated that Hewlett-Packard is a Nutanix customer. It is not, and the company misspoke.

The university started laying a foundation at a site along Western Avenue in 2007, but halted work because of the economic downturn in 2009. Now, the university plans to resume construction with a modified set of plans for a 497,000-square-foot Science and Engineering Complex that will include classrooms, research space, offices, and a giant central atrium.

Under the new plan, the building’s main tenant would be the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, rather than the Harvard Stem Cell Institute as previously envisioned. Engineering and science enrollment has tripled in recent years, Harvard said, boosting the need for space. The school anticipates 1,600 students and 360 staff will use the building on a daily basis, and that it will reach a height of 107 feet, or six stories.

An aerial rendering of the area with existing buildings. The proposed science and engineering complex is outlined in red.

“Encompassing a broad range of research areas — from robotics to computer science to 3D printing — the SEC will accommodate research, teaching, and social spaces,” the school said in its filing. “The design of the building balances the demands of varied disciplines and specialties; areas for focused retreat [will be] mixed with spaces for integrated communication and collaboration.”

Megan Pearce, a police dispatcher with the Warren Police Department, says she suffered ""extreme emotional trauma"" after realizing that she was being spied on in her home, she alleges in the civil suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Detroit.

She accuses Michael Emmi, a 15-year officer with Michigan's Hazel Park Police Department, of accessing her Nest Cam baby monitor and watching her, which she says amounts to an illegal search and a violation of wiretapping, privacy and eavesdropping laws.

""Emmi, who is paid to uphold the law, perversely and illegally spied on her and her infant son, in one of the most intimate and private moments between a mother and her baby imaginable, to satisfy his prurient voyeurism,"" the lawsuit alleges.

Events began to unfold on March 2 after Emmi and other officers arrested Pearce's fiancé and the baby's father, Cody Fuhrman, on marijuana charges. Pearce's attorney, Kevin Ernst, tells PEOPLE Fuhrman was a

under the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act, but is accused of having more marijuana than allowed.

Fuhrman's iPhone, from which he could view goings-on in the nursery via the Nest Cam, was confiscated and ""purportedly"" logged into evidence, according to the suit. The next day, Pearce took a bath with her baby and then walked into the nursery while both were nude and began breast-feeding him, Ernst says.

After noticing that the camera's light was flashing, indicating that someone was watching, Pearce activated the ""Find my iPhone"" feature for Fuhrman's phone and traced it to Emmi's home, according to the suit.

""This guy took the evidence home,"" Ernst says.

Pearce tried cutting off access from the iPhone to the Nest Cam, and believed she had eliminated the connection. However, that evening as she repeated her routine of bathing and breastfeeding she noticed the camera's light blinking again, Ernst says.

""He is a creep,"" Ernst says of Emmi. ""It's so brazen to me. How did he think he could do this? It's so sickening.""

In addition to feeling ""violated,"" Ernst says Pearce is also worried the footage will wind up on the Internet.

Pearce is seeking unspecified monetary damages from Emmi, who is named in the suit as a private individual and not in his role as a police officer.

Hazel Park Police Chief Martin Barner defended Emmi, telling PEOPLE he is a ""fine upstanding officer."" Barner added, ""I find it very hard to believe that these allegations will be proven in a court of law.""

Barner noted that Pearce's fiancé has been charged with drug crimes and ""this was maybe filed to try to assist her boyfriend in the future,"" he says. ""I'm not sure it's retaliation or trying to use it as a bargaining chip.""

Emmi is assigned to a narcotics enforcement team through the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, which has begun an internal investigation, Barner says.

The company had been forced to cut the price for the Hero 4 Session by $100 in the fourth quarter to help lift its sales after cutting it another $100 a few months earlier. The camera now sells for $199, or a 50% discount from its original $399 launch price.

GoPro now says it will take a $21 million charge for the price cuts along with another $30 million to $35 million charge for “excess purchase order commitments, excess inventory, and obsolete tooling,” according to a press release.

404,"An internet user who claims to be a European living in China has shared a video of the government's crude attempts to censor coverage of the ongoing political unrest in Hong Kong.

The video posted on LiveLeak shows what appears to be a BBC news broadcast about the protests suddenly cut to a black screen before a message reportedly about technical difficulties is flashed across the screen.

""As soon as the TV channel shows something which is contrary to the government policy (i.e. Hong Kong protests, the Dalai Lama, reporting pieces on the wealth of the CCP party leaders) then the feed gets cut, the TV goes black – and bizarrely – we get to watch a loop feed of parries and flowers, with a subtitle that says the 'signal has technical problems',"" LiveLeak user MattHK wrote online.

The video comes a day after after the BBC's website was blocked in China, only hours after a video of Hong Kong police beating and kicking a pro-democracy protester began circulating online.

The move appears to be the first time the British broadcaster's English-language website has been completely blocked in China since December 2010, when it was inaccessible for days before the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony for Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.

In a statement yesterday, BBC director of global news Peter Horrocks said the move against the Chinese-language website ""appears to be deliberate censorship"".

""The BBC strongly condemns any attempts to restrict free access to news and information and we are protesting to the Chinese authorities,"" Horrocks said.

""The BBC provides impartial, trusted news to millions of people around the world, and attempts to censor our news services show just how important it is to get our accurate information to them.""

In a Twitter posting yesterday, BBC's Asia bureau chief Jo Floto noted that Chinese authorities also have a ""usual practice of blacking out BBC World during Hong Kong reports"".

China's Communist Party oversees a vast censorship system that aggressively blocks sites or snuffs out internet and TV content and commentary on topics considered sensitive, such as Beijing's human rights record and criticisms of the government.

The New York Times and Bloomberg have had their websites blocked in China since they published investigations in 2012 into the family wealth of former premier Wen Jiabao and President Xi Jinping respectively.

As pro-democracy protests in China's semi-autonomous region of Hong Kong escalated late last month, online censors moved to block the photo-sharing app Instagram, which joined Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as popular social media platforms inaccessible in mainland China.

The blocking of the BBC's website came as a video of Hong Kong police beating a pro-democracy protester went viral on the internet.

In the video, released by Hong Kong television network TVB, a group of six plainclothes officers are shown assaulting a handcuffed and unarmed protester for several minutes.

405,"U.S. economic growth slowed sharply at the start of the year, according to the latest reading of U.S. gross domestic product.

The broad measure of goods and services produced by the economy grew at a 0.2% annual rate in the first three months of the year.

Economists had expected the economy to grow at an already modest 1% pace in the first quarter of 2015. The U.S. economy grew at a more healthy 2.2% pace in the fourth quarter 2014, and by 5% in the prior quarter.

Wednesday’s reading was a big step down from the fourth quarter’s 2.2% pace and marked the weakest reading in a year.

A strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at normally busy West Coast ports also slammed growth, the government said.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy expanding at a 1% rate. While the weak GDP figures could rattle financial markets, the growth slowdown is probably not a true reflection of the economy’s health, given the role of temporary factors such as the weather and the ports dispute.

The first-quarter GDP snapshot was released just hours before U.S. Federal Reserve officials conclude a two-day policy meeting. Policymakers at the central bank are expected to acknowledge the softer growth, but shrug it off as temporary in a statement they will issue after their gathering.

While there are signs the economy is pulling out of the soft patch, data on home building, manufacturing, retail sales and business investment suggest the rebound will lack the vigor seen last year when the economy snapped back after being blindsided by cold weather.

At the start of this year, many economists believed the Fed would raise interest rates from near zero in June. Now, most of the guessing centers around September.

The government did not quantify the impact of the weather, the strong dollar and the ports disruptions on growth last quarter. Economists, however, estimate unusually cold weather in February chopped off as much as half a percentage point, with the port disruptions shaving off a further 0.3 percentage point.

The weather impact was evident in weakness in consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.9% rate. That was the slowest in a year and followed a brisk 4.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter.

The sharp moderation in consumer spending came even though households enjoyed huge savings from a big drop in gasoline prices. Consumers boosted their savings to $727.8 billion from $603.4 billion in the fourth quarter.

Construction also took a hit from the weather, while lower energy prices, which have cut into domestic oil production, undermined business investment.","Harsh weather, a strong dollar, and a now-resolved labor dispute at normally busy West Coast ports slammed growth.",Generated Summary: U.S.
406,"Despite never finishing college, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is urging today’s students to graduate with a university degree, touting it as “a much surer path to success.”

It’s a message contrary to some other tech luminaries in recent years who’ve discouraged younger people from taking on unmanageable debt for a degree that may not prove worth its cost.

But Gates, who dropped out of college to start Microsoft, points out that by 2025 two-thirds of all jobs in the U.S. will require education beyond high school. At the rate the U.S. is currently producing college grads, the nation is looking at a shortfall of 11 million skilled workers to fill those rolls over the next 10 years, according to a study by Georgetown University.

And the payoff is worth it, says Gates.

College graduates are more likely to find a rewarding job, earn higher income, and even, evidence shows, live healthier lives than if they didn’t have degrees. They also bring training and skills into America’s workforce, helping our economy grow and stay competitive. That benefits everyone.

It’s just too bad that we’re not producing more of them.

The problem isn’t that enough people aren’t going to college, Gate’s points out. It’s that not enough are completing those degrees. More than 36 million Americans have enrolled in college and left without a degree in hand. There are many reasons behind why students drop out–and poverty is a key issue.

A conference on the health of rural children this week heard from Caterina Giorgi, director of policy and research at the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education, who called on the government to explain its inaction and address the recommendations.

Related: Foetal alcohol syndrome should be recognised as disability, says report on Indigenous alcohol use

A parliamentary select committee on action to prevent foetal alcohol spectrum disorder tabled its report in February 2015, and found the condition was doing “untold harm to children in the Northern Territory”.

FASD is an umbrella term for a range of permanent behavioural, learning and developmental disabilities resulting from exposure to alcohol in utero. There is no national data on prevalence but studies have found higher rates among Indigenous Australians, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

The select committee’s report made 26 recommendations including “alcohol management and support services, sexual health, pregnancy support, early childhood support and education services, and FASD diagnostic and support services”.

“However, the greatest gains are to be obtained through prevention, and key to prevention is alcohol management and restriction of supply.”

Giorgi, who addressed the Country Kids conference in Alice Springs on Monday, said the NT government’s implementation of policies and programs had been unacceptably slow, or non-existent.

“Many Australian states and territories have taken action to prevent, manage and diagnose FASD over the last five years and there is an increased awareness of the need to take a whole-of-community approach to FASD,” Giorgi said.

“But the NT government is dragging its feet in responding to the FASD inquiry report and is fixated on punitive approaches that ignore the evidence.”

The health minister, John Elferink, has been contacted for comment but has previously pointed to the NT government’s measures to reduce alcohol consumption, including stationing police outside bottle shops, and enforcing paperless arrests – a highly controversial policy of detaining problem drinkers without charge.

The alcohol policy has been criticised as unfairly targeting Indigenous people, and going against the recommendations of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody.

In March he told the Guardian he was disappointed the inquiry did not address “the one issue I wanted them to look at” – an idea of “confining pregnant women who are knowingly drinking while they are pregnant”.

Speaking in the context of an Aboriginal woman with FASD, Roseanne Fulton, who had been detained without conviction because she was unfit to stand trial, Elferink acknowledged there was “a massive problem coming down the tube towards governments” with FASD cases.

He predicted an increase in manifestations in the NT. “The reason for that is we now have a society that tells people they’re not responsible for their actions,” he said.

“And they engage in getting free money through a passive welfare system, they sit around in parks and gardens, they drink to their hearts’ content, knowing they’re pregnant, knowing they’re causing a massive problem into the future and they just don’t care.”

In parliament Elferink said the recommendation relating to a diagnostic tool was concerning because he “suspected they may not be able to develop” one, but Giorgi told reporters a diagnostic tool would be finalised and in use among health workers from May this year.

The Labor MLA Gerry McCarthy told Elferink in parliament the committee – of which McCarthy is a member – had given him more a holistic view than simply recommending the law he was looking for.

“The time is now, minister, and time is ticking as it has been for decades,” he said. “It has been your opportunity as a minister for the crown, and the Giles CLP government, to address this.”","Fourteen months after a report into the condition’s effects, the government is yet to implement a single recommendation","Generated Summary: The Northern Territory government is yet to implement a single recommendation from a report into the effects of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, 14 months after it was handed down."

Soon to become the third largest brewer in the world behind Heineken following the planned mega-merger of AB Inbev and SAB Miller, the group last week announced the sale of its 59% share in African subsidiary Carlsberg Malawi to local Castel Group.

The chief executive said more assets were “on the list” to be divested but declined to name them in order not to weaken his negotiating position. His plan is to focus on big cities, craft beer, and core markets.

As part of his strategy, Carlsberg has shed 2,080 white collar employees, sold assets in Britain, closed 11 breweries in China, and written down the value of its ailing Russia business.

412,"A parliamentary inquiry into Tasmania's greyhound racing industry rejects calls to ban the sport, citing no substantive evidence of live baiting in the state in recent years.

In a 316-page report tabled in state parliament on Wednesday a cross-party committee made 31 recommendations, several focused on strengthening animal welfare regulations.

The inquiry was sparked by revelations of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets in NSW where the government has since banned the sport.

""While the committee received anecdotal evidence implying illegal practices it received no substantive evidence of live baiting occurring in the Tasmanian greyhound industry, in recent years,"" the report reads.

Among the 18 witnesses who gave evidence during a series of public hearings was Rod Andrewartha.

""I have been chief veterinary officer for nearly 16 years and before that I worked in a clinical practice for the government, and at no time have I ever heard or seen evidence of live baiting,"" he said.

""Training with a mechanical lure in Tasmania only occurs on properties owned and operated by Tasracing and supervised by its staff or experienced club officials.

""The Tasmanian properties are locked at night and are subject to regular

But the committee conceded it cannot be certain that live baiting is not occurring in the island state.

Tasmanian Greens leader Cassy O'Connor disagreed with the committee's findings and said the inquiry has failed.

""During the course of the inquiry we received substantial and damning evidence that live baiting is a practice that has and potentially still is happening in Tasmania,"" she told parliament on Wednesday.

413,"Pop art’s influence has been felt in cultures far different from its American and British incubators. The works in a new exhibit feature a Russian troika, peasants shouting corporate names and imagery merging the French and Chinese revolutions.

The show that opened Wednesday at the Saatchi Gallery in London traces Pop art’s disciples in China, Taiwan and the former Soviet Union. With 250 works from 110 artists, “Post-Pop: East Meets West” explores how a new generation of artists from regions with radically different ideologies embraced the movement.

In the 1950s, Pop masters in Britain and the U.S., like Andy Warhol, Richard Hamilton and Roy Lichtenstein, drew from advertisements, mass-produced goods and a common vernacular to comment on an increasingly consumerist culture.

After the Cold War and the rise of capitalism in China, Pop art became an influential reference point that allowed artists to combine Western capitalist culture and their own histories. For example, some paintings of China’s Wang Guangyi, born in 1957, show red and yellow peasant figures with raised fists, surrounded by brand logos like Swatch and Benetton rather than by slogans of political protest.

Some artists created direct homages to Pop. Russia’s Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe, who died last year at age 43, photographed himself covered in paint and with his hand resting on his chin, as in a famous Warhol self-portrait.

Other artists reappropriated Pop art concepts. A large-scale painting depicting a Russian troika sleigh by Vladimir Dubossarsky and Alexander Vinogradov was an imaginary advertisement for foreign tourists, though its style recalls 19th-century academic paintings.

“If you look at the origins of Pop art, even then there was some misunderstanding that it reflected a longing or fantasy about the American way of life,” said Marco Livingstone, who curated the show with Andrey Erofeev and Chang Tsong-Zung. “The same thing is replicated 20 or 30 years later in reproductions of Pop art,” Mr. Livingstone said. But these younger artists are criticizing Pop art works or “using them as a reference to impose their own views.”

Mr. Chang pointed to a pair of paintings by Liu Dahong that conflate imagery from the French Revolution and the Chinese Cultural Revolution. “It’s a reinvention of Chinese history, by mapping it onto a foreign model,” he said.

The artists in the show “are using imagery that a man in the street understands, and which feels more accessible,” said Nigel Hurst, chief executive of the Saatchi Gallery.

416,"Roof-top meetings and friendly colleagues helped to make Twitter’s employees the happiest in the country, according to a report published Friday.

The microblogging company received the highest rating from its own workers in terms of corporate culture and values on career website Glassdoor.com, which studied the reviews of tens of thousands of employers. Twitter ended up with an average score of 4.5 for culture and values on a scale of 1 to 5.

The time period covered by the report – July 2013 to July 2014 – was certainly an eventful one for Twitter, which launched a successful IPO last fall that famously turned 1,600 of its employees into instant millionaires and, one would assume, pretty happy campers. Workers also get free meals at its San Francisco headquarters, in-office yoga classes and unlimited vacation, at least for exempt employees.

Glassdoor relies on employees’ opinions of their companies, which are submitted anonymously, to create its database of reviews of employers across dozens of industries. In addition to the scale of 1 to 5 rating, Glassdoor also asks employees to submit more specific thoughts on their companies’ cultures and values.

“Team meetings on the roof are the best, great teamwork and a lot of smart people,” one self-described software engineer at Twitter told Glassdoor. That employee added that the company’s core values help steer Twitter’s in a positive direction, while an anonymous Twitter account executive said “everyone is friendly” at the company.

Glassdoor community expert Scott Dobroski told Fortune that, overall, three common themes emerged from all of the employee comments. “We saw employees talking about a supportive and motivational team-oriented environment,” he says. “We saw employees talking about working for companies that had a great mission statement and generally did the right thing and acted with integrity.”

And, finally, Dobroski says employees wanted to feel like they had “a second family” at the workplace, where they could turn to colleagues for support and advice.

Rounding out the top three on Glassdoor’s culture and values ranking behind Twitter were public relations firm Edelman and Internet giant Google GOOG , both of which had an average rating of 4.4 out of 5. Edelman workers who reviewed their employer on Glassdoor pointed to the “entrepreneurial spirit” of the agency, while one Google researcher said that company features a “culture of respect.”

Tech companies dominated the top rankings with 11 of the top 25 slots including Facebook, Intuit and Apple. Dobroski says employees at such companies likely rate their employers highly when it comes to culture and values because they really buy into the companies’ mission statements.

“Part of their mission statement at these three companies is to make the world more connected and open . . . So, we see the employees really love working there because they believe in the mission,” Dobroski says.

Dobroski says company culture is among the top five factors that prospective employees consider when looking for a new job. But despite all the feel-good philosophy, salary is, in the end, the most important factor in the ratings, he says. Of course, tech company wages are quite high compared with average national salaries. Tech companies also shower workers with free perks.

Retail was the second most -represented industry on the list with three companies getting high marks from employees for their culture and values including grocery-store chains HEB HEB and Wegmans. The only restaurant chain on the list was Chick-fil-A, which ranked seventh.

Of course, not all is rosy at top ranked companies like Twitter. It’s share price has fallen to almost $30 at one point this year after reaching a high of more than $70 in 2013. But its stock TWTR has since rebounded somewhat and is up almost 19% in just the past month.

The museum will feature Lucas’ collection of paintings, illustrations and digital art.

The bonds would be issued by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority for the museum and the replacement of a big part of its the half-century old McCormick Place convention center that would be razed for the project.

Lucas would contribute $743 million to the authority for the museum. The financing plan also calls for the extension of taxes and millions of dollars from the state of Illinois, which is also low on revenue.

The proposal could be Emanuel’s last effort to secure the project for the city. In urging lawmakers to approve the plan, the mayor warned that other cities—Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco—would “like Chicago to fumble here,” he said. “And there’s a reason we all have to work together not to fumble.”

420,"With her party’s convention behind her, Hillary Clinton has started to officially plan for her White House transition, putting two longtime aides in charge of the effort.

John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, will serve as the president and Minyon Moore, a senior adviser, the secretary of the Clinton-Kaine Transition Fund, a nonprofit group that will oversee the effort, according to paperwork filed on Wednesday to begin the formal process of planning a move to the White House.

In May, the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, put Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey in charge of his transition planning.

A cadre of policy aides to Mrs. Clinton, including Ann O’Leary and Ed Meier, will also help in the transition team’s effort, which will be largely focused on administration and developing a framework for Mrs. Clinton’s policy agenda and personnel appointments.

The White House has been preparing for months for a smooth handover of power to the new president in January, and on Friday, Denis McDonough, President Obama’s chief of staff, called Mr. Meier, one of Mrs. Clinton’s policy aides, and Mr. Christie to discuss the next steps in the process.

During the calls, said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman, Mr. McDonough invited representatives of both campaigns to begin attending transition-planning meetings and told them their campaigns could now arrange for intelligence briefings through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Mr. McDonough also told both campaigns that they were eligible to begin using office space in a Pennsylvania Avenue building a block from the White House, provided by the General Services Administration, to begin coordinating their transition planning.

A top White House official met in April with representatives of several presidential campaigns, including Mrs. Clinton’s and Mr. Trump’s, at a gathering at Kykuit, the estate built by John D. Rockefeller in New York’s Hudson Valley, to begin discussing transition preparations. Mr. McDonough convened the Cabinet in March to begin the administration’s transition planning, and both a White House Task Force and an agency transition committee began meetings in June to begin preparations.

Mr. Obama has told his top advisers that he benefited greatly from the transition process organized by President George W. Bush in 2008.

“The president aspires to meet, if not exceed, that very high standard that was set by the Bush White House,” Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, said on Wednesday.",The Clinton-Kaine Transition Fund officially filed paperwork to begin the formal process of planning a move to the White House.,"Generated Summary: With her party’s convention behind her, Hillary Clinton has started to officially plan for her White House transition, putting two longtime aides in charge of the effort."

422,"Two adjacent apartment buildings collapsed early Wednesday in western India, killing at least 11 people, police and firefighters said.

Rescue workers recovered 11 bodies and four badly injured people from the debris of the three-story buildings that fell in the city of Vadodara in Gujarat state, said fire chief Hitesh Taparia.

Most of the tenants in the first building, comprised of 14 apartments, were spleeping when the building collapsed. The adjacent building was evacuated just minutes before it came down, according to police officer Bhanu Pratap Parmar.

The buildings were part of 33 housing blocks constructed by the Gujarat government more than a decade ago to house the poor.

More than 250 rescue workers were working to clear debris from the site and search for survivors in the mountain of twisted metal, concrete slabs, bricks and mortar. The cause of the building collapse was not immediately clear.

According to police officials, there had been unusually heavy rain in Vadodara during monsoon season this year, which potentially could have damaged the foundation of the two buildings.

The Gujarat government has ordered an investigation into the collapse and will check for structural damage in the 31 other buildings in the complex, Taparia said.

Building collapses are common in India. Builders cut corners by using substandard materials and multistory structures are often built without proper supervision.

A massive demand for housing around India's cities and widespread corruption result in builders adding additional floors to buildings illegally, or putting up whole buildings entirely without proper approval.

In April a building collapse in Mumbai killed 72 people and injured 70 others. Sixty seven people died in November 2010 when a tenement filled with migrant workers collapsed in eastern part of New Delhi, largely a working-class area.

Governing didn’t analyze the reasons for Massachusetts’ success. However, the state’s economic metrics in recent years have consistently outpaced those of the country as a whole, on the strength of sectors such as technology, biotechnology, health care, and financial and other professional services.

The jump in the rankings — Massachusetts didn’t crack the top 10 in Governing’s previous list, in 2013 — may also have been helped by rapid declines in states whose economies are heavily dependent on natural resources. West Virginia, for example, ranked ninth in 2013 but plummeted to dead last this year, likely due to the near-collapse of its coal industry.

To arrive at its ranking, Governing looked at each state’s current unemployment rate, the change in that rate over the past year, its gross domestic product per-capita in 2015, the percent change in gross domestic product between 2014 and 2015, the percent change in personal income per capita from the third quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016, and the percentage growth in year-to-date increases in jobs for 2016.

The political publication created the list as part of a look at whether there is a correlation between a state’s economic performance and the popularity of its governor. And indeed, Governing found that approval ratings for governors of the top 10 states in its economic ranking averaged 62.1 percent, with none below 54 percent. Governors of the bottom 10 states, meanwhile, averaged 50.8 percent.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker enjoys a 72 percent approval rating, the highest of any governor in the country. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, on the other hand, has the second-lowest at just 29 percent — and his state’s economy ranked 42nd (though that’s an improvement over Connecticut’s 49th-place finish in 2013).

425,"Widespread child sexual abuse in Salvation Army homes across three states often went unreported because the victims didn't think they would be believed, a royal commission has found.

The commission has also criticised the Salvos for failing to take action when children did come forward, entrenching a culture in which staff and officers were able to continue to offend.

""In many instances, where knowledge of physical or sexual abuse was brought to the attention of the Salvation Army, it failed to follow its own orders and regulations,"" the commission said in its report released on Monday.

And in some cases, children who complained about their treatment were threatened with physical harm.

The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse examined the operation of four Salvation Army homes - Eden Park in Adelaide, Box Hill and Bayswater in Victoria and one at Nedlands in Western Australia, between 1940 and 1980.

They were among 55 separate homes run by the organisation across Australia from 1894 to 1998.

Thirteen former residents gave evidence detailing shocking instances of both physical and sexual abuse.

Graham Rundle, 64, who was sent to Eden Park when he was just seven, said he was abused at least 200 times.

Another described the home as a ""hell hole"" where going to bed was a terrifying experience with boys regularly taken away to bathrooms to be abused.

Other victims told how they were bashed for no reason or locked in a small room with no windows for punishment.

During the commission hearings in Adelaide last year, senior Salvation Army officials offered an apology for the years of abuse and acknowledged that the organisation had not acted properly when offences were reported.

From 1995 to 2014 the army received a total of 418 claims for compensation and paid out $18 million.

However the commission found that in some cases it relied on technical defences, statutes of limitation and other methods to determine the size of any settlement and its liability.

426,"Natural gas and electricity prices may be on the rise, but home heating prices are dropping for one group of consumers: long-suffering homeowners who heat with oil.

Nearly 3 in 10 Massachusetts households are still using oil to heat their homes, compared to just six percent of households nationwide. According to a new estimate from the Energy Information Administration, the average household that heats with oil will save $632 this winter because of plunging oil prices. That’s an average savings of 27 percent.

Heating oil prices are already shaping up to be lower than last year. According to a weekly state survey, the average price for a gallon of heating oil hit $3.20 this week, down seven cents from the week before and 72 cents from the same time last year. The lowest price in the state’s survey was $2.52 per gallon.

427,"Today, toy makers are competing against smartphones and tablets for kids’ attention. So Barbie’s parent company is getting creative.

On Thursday, Barbie’s maker, Mattel, and Quirky, a company turning people’s ideas into real products and gadgets, unveiled a partnership to jointly produce toys based on ideas from Quirky’s crowd-sourced community of amateur inventors.

“We’ve been getting toy ideas since we launched the site in 2009,” Quirky founder and CEO Ben Kaufman told Fortune.

The New York City-based company has tried to harness the increasingly popular “maker” movement by asking the public to submit ideas that the company could then turn into real mass-produced products. If a proposal is selected, Quirky takes care of the entire process including design, manufacturing, and distribution. The idea’s originator, whether a stay-at-home mom or amateur gadget maker, shares in the royalties.

However, after largely running its whole operation independently after its founding six years ago, Quirky has started to branch out, first with its partnership with General Electric in 2012 to focus on home electronics. It also recently added audio company Harman as a partner followed by Mattel.

“This is basically us realizing that doing inventions for large corporations is going to be a very big and lucrative business for us,” Kaufman said.

Quirky’s process remains largely the same even with the new partners involved. People can continue to submit their ideas through Quirky’s traditional process. If Quirky’s internal committee selects an idea to pursue that falls into a partner’s wheelhouse, then that partner can decide if it wants Quirky to bring it to market or whether it prefers to do so on its own. But in either case, the product is co-branded, and 3.5% of the royalties go to whoever came up with the idea, Kaufman said.

The company’s new business strategy first became clear when it announced earlier this week it had acquired Undercurrent, a design and consulting firm, to help it broker and navigate these partnerships. “Our goal is to make sure that every single category has a partner,” Kaufman said, though he said his company would continue to make electronics and home products on its own.

As for Mattel, it’s uncertain what exactly it gains by pairing up with Quirky. On one hand, Mattel MAT posted mixed first quarter results under new CEO Christopher Sinclair Thursday. It beat analysts’ low expectations for the quarter while some of its toy brands showed improvements in sales. But others like Barbie didn’t fare as well, and the company’s overall revenue dropped by 2.5%. While the Quirky partnership could help give Mattel a fresh take on toys and possibly yield a hit or two, these partnerships often account for only a small part of the large companies’ overall businesses.

On the other hand, Quirky’s partnership with General Electric GE did produce an egg holder for refrigerators, a milk container, a smartphone-operated air conditioning unit, and Wink, a brand of Internet-connected home appliances successful enough that it was spun out as a standalone company.

He says that the decision was not related to any troubles with Shutterfly SFLY , which he believes “still has plenty of runway ahead from a growth perspective.” Instead, Regan was attracted by the opportunity to be involved with a broader set of industry verticals.

Prior to joining Shutterfly in August 2012, he had held finance roles with Ticketmaster LVY , Expedia EXPE and LendingTree TREE .

“I’ll have day-to-day CFO responsibilities with Spectrum and I’ll have to get up to speed on the mechanics of private equity, which should be an interesting growth curve,” Regan explains. “But if it was just the CFO role, that would have been of less interest to me and there were plenty of of Silicon Valley unicorns I spoke with that were looking for that. What I’ll get to do is become actively involved with portfolio companies and help them run better, whether it be identifying executive leadership, mentoring CFOs, handling scaling challenges or any of the other things I’ve lived through.”

Regan said he is unclear if he will remain on the board of Demand Media DMD , which he had joined earlier this year as an independent director. Spectrum currently holds a 13.9% equity stake in the company, which runs news websites, and is already represented on the board by managing director Victor Parker.

“I’d love to stay involved if governance will allow, but that has to be determined,” Regan says.

430,"Brooklyn grade schoolers are first to test drive a high-tech classroom tool celebrating legendary ballplayer and activist Jackie Robinson.

Frequent squeals of “Wow!” by the kids on Monday afternoon made it pretty clear that it was a home run.

That excited cry, along with shouts of “Look at that!” and “Turn this way!,” popped up frequently as fifth graders at P.S. 375 — also known as Jackie Robinson School — took the “trip” via Google Expeditions, a virtual classroom excursion accessible with Google Cardboard, a gizmo that looks an old View Master or toy goggles. Add a smartphone and a special app and you’re ready to roll.

Launched in September, Google Expeditions has already ferried kids from Philadelphia to the White House to Mars. Along with Google brainiacs, this new virtual experience was created in about two months in partnership with documentarian Ken Burns, whose new “Jackie Robinson” miniseries airs tonight and Tuesday on PBS.

“There’s no better place than Jackie Robinson School to premiere this,” Burns told the Daily News before the afternoon test drive.

JACKIE ROBINSON'S CONTRACTS DISPLAYED IN TIMES SQUARE

Addressing the enthusiastic 10- and 11-year-olders, he called Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers star, the “original civil rights fighter.”

Robinson’s daughter, Sharon, also was on-hand and spoke to the kids about what it meant to break “the color barrier.”

As kids looked into toylike goggles, they saw a picture of that very moment in 1947 when the world turned a corner at Ebbets Field — which was once a stone’s throw from the classroom.

On that day, Robinson, the first black player in Major League Baseball walked up to the plate and into history books.

What kids saw Monday was a historic image of Ebbets field overlaid atop a contemporary image of the area. Past and present fused in 3-D, high-definition 360-degree glory.

As kids held the cardboard goggles to their eyes they turned left and right, looked up and down — in order to take in the full scope of the panoramic view inside the cardboard visor.

They squealed and wriggled to enjoy the full view.

Esther Powell, their teacher, saw the same images on an Android connected to the gizmos. She directed students to visuals inside the viewfinders and periodically paused the tour. The words “Paused by teacher” appeared inside the goggles, prompting groans from kids eager to see Robinson’s story unfold.

Powell, who has taught at the school for 15 years, used the breaks to underscore the imagery and quotes. The teacher discussed how he left a legacy that people needed to follow.

Fifth-grader Amy Menjivar, 11, was just one student impressed by the Expedition and the subject. “Jackie Robinson fascinates me,” she told the News. “He knew he couldn’t play baseball because of this skin color. But he stood up for his rights and did.”

Powell added, “Visuals make clear what words don’t.” Google is planning to roll the Jackie Robinson Expedition out to other schools, but doesn’t have an exact timeline yet.

Danczuk was reported to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) by a member of the public in relation to expenses claimed for having his four children stay with him at his second home in London.

The MP has two children with his wife Karen, from whom he is separated, and another two children with his ex-wife Sonia Rossington. The complaint is understood to relate to claims that his oldest two children do not routinely stay with him in London.

The MPs’ handbook states: “A supplement of up to £2,425 a year for each dependant you care for. You will need to certify that the dependant routinely lives with you.”

Ipsa confirmed its compliance officer had launched an investigation on Monday.

In a statement, it said: “Following receipt of a complaint from a member of the public, the compliance officer for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has today opened an investigation into claims made under the MPs’ scheme of business costs and expenses by Simon Danczuk MP.

“The expenditure under investigation relates to accommodation expenditure claimed under the scheme.”

Danczuk has previously said he was told by Ipsa when he made the initial claim that it was acceptable and said all four children had stayed with him on numerous occasions.

In response to the investigation, he released a statement saying the claim was “made properly and based on my honest interpretation of the Ipsa regulations”.

“I maintain that the existing rules are poorly worded and not fit for purpose when it comes to modern families like mine,” he said. “Some of my parliamentary colleagues have approached me in the last week to say they agree with me on this point and that they have interpreted the rules the same way.

433,"PayPal and Visa, longtime frenemies, looked more like friends on Thursday afternoon after announcing a new partnership.

The deal calls for PayPal to start sharing data with Visa about transactions that are funded using Visa cards. The deal also tries to resolve Visa’s complaints that PayPal encouraged its users to tap their bank accounts rather than their credit cards as a way to avoid paying Visa’s credit card fees.

Visa has long been frustrated with PayPal because the payments giant encourages its 188 million users to use their bank accounts to fund their PayPal digital wallets through what is known as ACH. It saves PayPal on every transaction because Visa and MasterCard charge higher fees.

In turn, Visa has wanted to PayPal to stop encouraging its users to use bank accounts, and start pushing them to use credit cards, so it can collect fees.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Visa’s CEO Charlie Scharf criticized PayPal for the practice in May, according to Recode:

I’ve been very, very clear on this one which is if you are a foe, you’re not a friend. And PayPal’s historic model, on the one hand, 50% of the volume is ACH, the other 50 percent is general purpose cards of which we’re half of it. So, they drive a lot of business our way. That’s supposedly the friend part of it.

The foe part is where they then use historically those transactions to do everything they can to get those to ACH where we and our clients get disintermediated from the transaction, the entire experience, and it causes tremendous customer service problems for the bank specifically.

The other bone Visa has to pick is that when Visa cardholders pay using their PayPal wallets, Visa doesn’t get any of the transaction data.

For more on PayPal, watch:

With Thursday’s deal, PayPal said it would no longer encourage Visa cardholders to link their bank accounts instead of their credit cards. PayPal will also start sharing data about Visa-funded transactions with the credit card company, which the company says will be similar to the data collected when a Visa card is swiped at a store or used online. Additionally, PayPal will be able to be used as a payment option at any retail location that accepts contactless payments for Visa cardholders.

In turn, Visa promises to not increase fees for PayPal, and is offering undisclosed “economic incentives” for increased volume of payments through Visa cards. It doesn’t appear that PayPal has a similar relationship with MasterCard or American Express.

Meanwhile, PayPal continues to grow, after spinning out of eBay last year. In the second quarter, PayPal processed $86 billion in payments volume, up 29% from the same quarter in 2015. It also processed $24 billion in mobile payment volume, up 56% from the second quarter in 2015.

434,"A man accused raping a young woman on the grounds of a Brisbane cathedral should be acquitted because their interactions were ""consensual"", a jury has heard.

Mitchell Cameron Peggie, 26, has pleaded not guilty to raping and sexually assaulting the then-21-year-old when the pair met up after making contact via online dating site Oasis in August last year.

On Tuesday, his barrister Douglas Wilson told jurors the defence case was the conduct was ""between consenting adults"".

He said while his client was ""forthright"" about the events of the night, his alleged victim was ""evasive"" when she gave evidence.

Text message exchanges between the two before the meeting were indicative of two people flirting and showed Peggie was ""direct"" about how he thought the date would go, Mr Wilson said.

But he urged jurors not to infer guilt given the sexual nature of some of the messages, suggesting that type of language was used regularly by younger people.

It came after they heard crown prosecutor Brendan White outline the complainant's version of events on Monday.

The woman alleges he placed his hand around her neck, turned her body and raped her against the wall of the Cathedral of St Stephen after the pair left a CBD bar and walked into the grounds.

In his own closing, Mr White said it was understandable the woman was defensive in evidence because she was being accused of lying about a traumatic experience.

He suggested Peggie's account was a ""made-up work of fictional fantasy"" and text messages indicated he wasn't taking the hint when she didn't welcome his explicit comments.

Mr White told the jury her wearing lingerie on the night didn't mean she was consenting to sexual activity, quoting her testimony: ""Just because I wore it doesn't mean I wanted anyone else to see it"".

""(Rape) doesn't have to be a stereotype of a stranger through a window at night,"" he concluded.

""It happens when a woman says no, and a man keeps going.""

In December 2004, the 10-year-old English schoolgirl was vacationing on the coast of Thailand with her parents and her younger sister Holly.

""It was like paradise -- white sand and blue turquoise sea,"" Tilly remembered.

On the morning of Dec. 26, the family went for a long walk on the beach. But Tilly, now 14, noticed something was very different about the ocean that day.

""The water was really, really frothy. It wasn't calm and it wasn't going in and then out,"" she said. ""It was just coming in and in and in.""

She remembered that everything she was seeing reminded her of a lesson on tsunamis she'd had at school just a few weeks before.

Tilly's mother Penny Smith remembered that her daughter began to get hysterical as she desperately tried to convince her parents to return to the hotel.

""She kept saying, 'It bubbles, the water bubbles.' That's what she kept saying to me like that -- and it goes round and round. 'It's the water,' she kept saying, 'It's the water,'"" Smith said.

Tilly's parents ignored her, but she persisted. ""There is gonna be a tsunami, listen to me,"" Tilly said she told her parents,

She finally convinced her father, Colin Smith, to turn back to their hotel, where he approached a security guard stationed on the beach.

""And I said, 'Look, you probably think I'm absolutely bonkers, but my daughter's completely convinced there's gonna be a tsunami,'"" he said.

Thankfully, the security guard listened to Colin Smith and his daughter Tilly that day in Thailand and began warning visitors. As dozens of tourists began streaming toward the hotel, Colin Smith waved frantically at his wife to return.

They were moving just off the beach when the massive tsunami surged toward shore.

""And then the next thing I remember is, Penny running, screaming 'Get the kids!'"" Colin Smith said. ""And I looked round and the water was just coming out of the sea.""

Everyone has a so-called ""disaster personality"" -- a personal way of reacting in a sudden crisis, such as the way Tilly handled the oncoming tsunami.

And while a few people behave heroically, the truth is that most of us will simply helplessly freeze.

Several others have also been injured after fighting broke out in a restaurant parking lot in Waco between the rival groups, who reportedly used clubs and knives before pulling guns.

It is understood police were in the parking lot trying to secure the area and protect citizens when the gunfire began.

Eight people died at the scene and another later died after being transported to hospital. It is unknown if all who died were gang members, or if some were bystanders.

Waco police said on Facebook that no officers were injured in the incident.

They warned residents to stay away from the area, confirming several armed people had been arrested at the scene.

The customer, identified in US media reports as Elizabeth Becerra, was filmed as she drove through a Starbucks franchise in Lakewood, California.

The video was uploaded to the YouTube account of Ms Becerra’s brother on Sunday and has racked up more than 800,000 views in the days since.

In the clip, Ms Becerra orders a coffee before lashing out at the young cashier, dubbing her a “fraud”.

She accuses the cashier of clocking up a US$212 (A$294) bill at a grocery store after stealing her credit card details during a routine purchase on New Year’s Day.

“We got you on camera yesterday at Ralph’s for $212, so just know that the cops are coming up here,” a furious Ms Becerra told the cashier.

“They recorded your a-- and everything, you took a copy of my f------ card and everything the other day.

“You know what you did.”

Kate Spade New York, Emporio Armani, Chaps, Diesel, Michael Kors, Misfit, Skagen, and Fossil are all planning to push out more than a hundred new Internet-connected watches and trackers this year aimed at making wearable tech more fashion-friendly.

The announcement comes just as smartwatches are eclipsing Swiss watch sales for the first time ever.

The Fossil Group is powering the tech behind the new products, betting that 2016 is going to be the year fitness tracking goes high-fashion. To get things started, Fossil is launching several new operating systems and apps to support all the new baubles.

“Customers will be delighted with the sheer volume of styles and options available when shopping for a wearable that fits their personal style,” said Fossil Group chief strategy and digital officer Greg McKelvey, in a release this week.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

It’s the latest move in Fossil’s big bet on wearable tech. The group acquired Misfit in November of last year for $260 million in a bid to get the company back on track after slow earnings earlier in 2015. Some of the Misfit trackers don’t need to be charged, which could make them easier to integrate into jewelry or accessories.

Though the company’s earnings improved in the fourth quarter, analysts are cautious about whether or not wearable tech fashion is something Fossil can really pull off, as MarketWatch reports.

442,"Donald Trump’s campaign has found a varied crew of supporters in recent months. The most recent addition is Silicon Valley billionaire and venture capitalist Peter Thiel.

Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and a director at Facebook, is now a Trump delegate in San Francisco, according to a Monday filing.

On the surface it seems like an unlikely alliance. Bad blood has been brewing between Silicon Valley’s top executives and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Trump since the start of the election cycle.

To Trump, Jeff Bezos is a scammer, Mark Zuckerberg is discriminatory, and Apple unpatriotic. On the other side of the ring, Silicon Valley executives including Elon Musk, Larry Page, and Tim Cook have not held back their disdain for the candidate—so much so that the group reportedly met with others in March to mock up a Trump takedown plan—though Elon Musk has denied the meeting.

But upon closer examination, Thiel’s support for Trump is not that odd. His political views have long diverged from the Silicon Valley norm. Thiel, a libertarian, has often made contributions to the Republican Party. He endorsed Mitt Romney for president in 2012 and Ron Paul in 2008. Last summer, Thiel donated $2 million to Carly Fiorina’s super PAC.

When asked in 2012 why he decided to back Ron Paul, Thiel told Slate: “The campaign really is for 2016 … I think we’re just trying to build a libertarian base for the next cycle.”

“It’s an unusually libertarian movement,” he said. “For the first time in perhaps 80 years, we have a chance to move the country in a more libertarian direction, with a less intrusive government, in both social and economic areas.”

And like Trump, Thiel is not shy about throwing provocative ideas out there. He once wrote that freedom and democracy are incompatible. His foundation, the Thiel Fellowship, provides $100,000 to students to drop out of college and pursue other work. He’s also funded a project to build sovereign islands where entrepreneurs can work without government influence.

443,"You’ve heard a million times that the modern Mediterranean diet is good for you. Now there’s stronger evidence the diet may be good for your brain, too.

In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Dr. Emilio Ros from the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain and his colleagues conducted a study of 447 men and women aged 55 to 80 years to see whether changing their diet could affect their performance on cognitive tests. The volunteers were healthy but at higher risk of developing heart-related problems; some smoked or had hypertension, for instance, others had a family history of heart issues. Everyone in the study was randomly assigned to eat, for about four years, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 1 liter of extra virgin olive oil a week, a Mediterranean diet enhanced with 30 grams of nuts a day, or a low-fat diet. The researchers performed a series of brain functioning tests on the participants at the start of the study and then at the end of the study.

MORE: Here’s Another Reason to Try the Mediterranean Diet

Both Mediterranean diet groups showed improvements compared to the low-fat diet group; those consuming more olive oil showed better memory scores at the end of the study while those eating more nuts showed improvements in executive function skills. The low-fat diet group, on the other hand, showed declines in many of the cognitive measures.

“It’s never too late to change your dietary patterns to improve your health,” says Ros. “This surprised even myself.” The results, he says, are especially encouraging since the people in the study were at higher risk of developing cognitive problems because of their heart-related risk factors, which can also impair cognitive function by increasing risk of stroke and compromising blood flow to the brain. “If you intervene with a healthy dietary pattern in people who are at risk of cognitive failure, even in people who still haven’t had any memory complaints or loss of cognitive function, you can prevent cognitive deterioration,” he says.

MORE: This Diet Has Been Linked to a Longer Life—Again

The findings support a growing body of evidence that connects the Mediterranean diet, which is high in antioxidant-rich foods like rich vegetables and fats, and improved brain function. Because researchers now believe that the brain is damaged by free radicals produced by stress, a diet that is rich in antioxidants may help to counter that harm. A previous study involving the same group of participants found similar brain benefits of olive oil and nuts, but that trial did not follow volunteers over time to measure the change associated with the dietary change.

MORE: Mediterranean Diet Better Than Low-Fat Diet in Keeping Aging Brains Sharp

While these results are promising, Ros says that more work is needed to confirm them; the current study is relatively small and did not find, for example, a strong correlation between the Mediterranean diet and the rate of mild cognitive impairment, a measure of cognitive decline that often precedes conditions like Alzheimer’s. “I think these results contribute to our understanding of healthy aging,” he says. “With a change in lifestyle as simple making some healthy choices in your food, it can make a difference.”",Simply adding more olive oil and nuts to your diet may help prevent memory problems and loss of cognitive skills that come with old age,"Generated Summary: You’ve heard a million times that the modern Mediterranean diet is good for you.

445,"Treasurer Scott Morrison has warned of a $1 trillion debt blowout in the next decade, should the new parliament fail to back his budget savings measures.

Mr Morrison said he intends to put their support to the test when MPs and senators return to Canberra next week.

He will present his plan to cut the corporate tax rate in increments to 25 percent over the next 10 years, a controversial proposal, but one Mr Morrison believes is critical for investment.

""Driving that investment on the non-mining sector of the economy is critically important to our growth going forward,"" Mr Morrison told a Bloomberg conference in Sydney today.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says the treasurer's warning is just another sign of the government blaming everyone else.

And, if anyone needed reminding, it was the Coalition that had increased the budget deficit and mismanaged the accounts.

""If the only plans they've got are plans, which nobody else wants to sign up to, they can keep saying that everybody else is wrong or they can have some quiet reflection and re-examine the way they're doing business,"" Mr Shorten told reporters in Canberra.

Crossbench senator Nick Xenophon says the government doesn't have a plan to deal with the manufacturing job losses when the auto-making sector shuts down by the end of 2017.

""We are facing a jobs cliff of up to 200,000 jobs,"" Senator Xenophon told reporters in Sydney.

Mr Morrison blamed an earnings problem for continued large budget deficits, having said repeatedly the budget suffered a spending problem rather than a revenue one.

Former Liberal leader John Hewson described it as ""stupid semantics"" because the government didn't want to be seen as potentially raising taxes.

""The bottom line is, if you put down all the expenditures measures and all the tax measures offered by both sides of politics they will probably together still be inadequate to bring about the necessary budget repair,"" Dr Hewson told Sky News.

The treasurer is concerned Australia's 25 years of consecutive economic growth has been steadily sowing the seeds of complacency.

A generation had grown up in an environment where receiving government payments is not seen as the preserve of the disadvantaged but a component of income over their entire life.

Mr Morrison believes there is a new divide - ""the taxed and the taxed nots"".

Oxfam chief executive Helen Szoke thought the comments ""alarming"", demonising the country's poor, when one in three large companies pay no tax.

The welfare lobby saw the comments as divisive, suggesting there was a whole lot of people relying on social security when the facts show the opposite.

""The treasurer is cooking up a recipe which will be very bad for the economy ... with an agenda which is about cutting social security potentially to the bone and at the same time delivering tax cuts at the high end,"" ACOSS chief Cassandra Goldie she told Sky News.

Private sector payrolls in the U.S. grew by 281,000 in June, according to a report by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing ADP and analysis provider Moody’s Analytics MCO . Economists had expected the report to show a 205,000 gain in employment, according to Bloomberg data.

“The June jobs number is a welcome boost,” said Carlos Rodriguez, president and CEO of ADP. “The number of construction jobs added was particularly encouraging, representing the highest total in that industry since February of 2006.”

Meanwhile, the May ADP employment remained unchanged from the 179,000 additional jobs reported a month ago. The ADP data excludes government employees.

The ADP data are released ahead of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly jobs report, which records non-farm payrolls, the unemployment rate and other data. The June jobs report is due Thursday morning ahead of the July 4 holiday, and economists expect it to show 215,000 jobs were created last month keeping the unemployment rate steady at 6.3%, the same as May.

“The job market is steadily improving,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “Job gains are broad based across all industries and company sizes. Judging from the job market, the economic recovery remains fully intact and is gaining momentum.”

448,"A recent wave of auto recalls may lead to even more flaws being discovered this year as drivers become alert to design faults, the top U.S. car safety official said on Tuesday.

Recalls of air bags and ignition switches last year contributed to an increase in the number of consumers with car safety concerns, said Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

While the auto safety agency may get about 45,000 consumer complaints a year, Rosekind estimated there were about 75,000 in 2014.

“I would expect that we will actually see an increase in recalls” this year, Rosekind told a group of reporters in his first media interview since taking over the agency in mid-December. “This is one of those cases where more recalls could actually mean the system is working better.”

NHTSA has been accused of acting too slowly to prevent dangers involving Takata Corp TKTDY air bags and General Motors Co GM ignition switches, and Rosekind said he must turn the agency around – fast.

“I got a couple years, max,” said Rosekind, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, whose term ends in January 2017. “The defect recall system – we just got to address that.”

Rosekind, a former academic and specialist on managing fatigue, spent the past four years as a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates major transportation accidents.

The agency he now leads has come under fire for its years-long, halting response to concerns that defective Takata air bags were rupturing upon deployment and spraying metal shards into cars – a flaw linked to at least five deaths.

Takata has resisted a national recall, though Honda Motor Co Ltd HNDAF , Toyota Motor Corp TOYOF and other carmakers have gone ahead with them. The agency has expressed dissatisfaction with Takata’s response on the issue so far.

Rosekind declined to say what steps he may take to push for a more comprehensive Takata recall.

The administrator did say carmakers bear the greatest burden for detecting defects and that he will not tolerate industry hiding what it knows about car design dangers.

“They are the ones that are required to provide information,” Rosekind said. He singled out General Motors for criticism of its handling of a flaw in the design of millions of ignition switches which can inadvertently turn off the engine and deactivate air bags while the vehicle is still moving.

That flaw has been blamed for at least 42 deaths.

“I am going to be looking for all the tools that are available to the agency to make sure stuff gets done,” he said.

One must-do, he said, is raise the $35 million limit on civil penalties for carmakers that botch or slow-walk recalls.

“It has to at least go to $300 (million),” he said, suggesting that the cap could be eliminated entirely.",New NHTSA says that's a good thing because it shows drivers are becoming more risk-aware.,"Generated Summary: A recent wave of auto recalls may lead to even more flaws being discovered this year as drivers become alert to design faults, the top U.S. car safety official said on Tuesday."
449,"By 2024, national health expenditures are forecast to be $5.43 trillion annually. Nearly half of that spending—47 percent—will be paid for by federal, state or local governments, primarily through the Medicare and Medicaid health coverage programs. That is up from 43 percent last year.

The rate of health spending growth being forecast represents a marked upswing from the historically low rate of health spending inflation of 4 percent annually seen between 2008—the first year of the worldwide economic downturn, and 2013, the year before the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions began taking full effect.

The rate began rising more significantly last year, when it grew by an estimated 5.5 percent to reach $3.1 trillion in total spending, the first time since 2007 that health inflation had topped 5 percent.

But the 5.8 percent annual average rate being forecast over the next decade is also much less the the average annual increases of about 9 percent seen in the 30 years prior to 2008, noted a report on the projection published Tuesday in the journal Health Affairs. The new forecast average rate is 0.1 percent point higher than what the Office of the Actuary last year had projected for the decade, but still represents ""modest"" growth, the report said.

""After six years of national health spending growth hovering near historically low rates, we're projecting faster growth in health spending, reflecting expanded insurance coverage under the ACA, expectations of continued improvements in the economy and population aging,"" said Sean Keehan, lead author of the Health Affairs report, and an economist in the Office of the Actuary.

""However, these projected growth rates are significantly lower than those observed over the three decades prior to the recent recession,"" Keehan said.

But increases in the numbers of insurance plans with higher cost-sharing requirements for customers, as well as reduced Medicare payments by the federal government, will help to keep the health spending rate below the 9 percent levels seen prerecession, according to the projection. More insurance plans are forcing enrollees to pay a bigger share of health costs out of pocket, which can keep the usage of medical services in check.

But because health inflation is expected to outpace inflation of the gross domestic product, as is typical, health spending will make up a larger part of overall U.S. spending by 2024.

Health spending in 2013 accounted for 17.4 percent of GDP. But by 2024, it is projected to make up 19.6 percent of GDP.

The forecast expects that spending from 2016 to 2018 will be grow by an average of 5.3 percent, but will speed up in following years, to 6.2 percent annually through 2024. The increase in later years is attributed to expected stronger economic growth, which usually is followed by increased use of health-care goods and services.","By 2024, national health expenditures are forecast to be $5.43 trillion annually, according to a new estimate.","Generated Summary: By 2024, national health spending growth being forecast represents a marked upswing from the historically low rate of health spending inflation of 4 percent annually seen between 2008 and 2010.

452,"A shopkeeper has been found guilty of murder after deliberately lighting a fire in his store in Sydney.

Adeel Khan, 46, had denied murdering Chris Noble, who lived above his Rozelle convenience store, after starting the fire in September 2014 in order to claim insurance and solve his financial problems.

But a jury at the New South Wales supreme court found him guilty on Friday of murdering the 27-year-old mechanic.

Khan, who has three children, stared ahead and showed no emotion when the guilty verdicts were handed down in Sydney.

The jurors also found him guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to Todd Fisher and wounding Corey Cameron, who were both injured in the fire, and dishonestly destroying property by means of fire with a view to gain.

The jury was unable to reach a verdict on whether Khan also murdered Noble’s next-door neighbour, Bianka O’Brien, and her baby boy Jude, who also died in the blaze. The jury will continue its deliberations on Tuesday.

Noble and the O’Briens lived above Khan’s store in Darling Street, and were killed when a large explosion and fire tore through the shop and reduced it to rubble.

Noble is thought to have become trapped in his room and texted his mother “I love you” in his final moments.

Khan was accused during the three-week trial of placing petrol-filled containers around his shop and lighting the fire in order to secure an insurance payout and to avoid lease obligations.

He denied this and testified that robbers had tied him up for hours, spilled fuel on the shop floor and left shortly before the blaze erupted.

Two nights before the fire Khan was filmed on CCTV buying 38 litres of fuel which he pumped into water containers.

Knocked unconscious and buried under rubble in the explosion, Khan told emergency workers who rescued him he was sorry.

453,"A Queensland couple have each been given life in prison for the sadistic torture and murder of mother-of-four Tia Landers.

Drug supplier John Edward Harris and his partner Linda Eileen Appleton were sentenced in Brisbane's Supreme Court on Friday after pleading guilty to murdering Ms Landers in a brutal and bloody encounter at their Brighton home in June 2014.

Harris will have to spend at least 27 years behind bars before being eligible for parole, while Appleton must serve at least 23 years.

Justice Jean Dalton ordered their parole eligibility to be set beyond the statutory 20-year minimum for the ""sadistic"" killing, where Ms Landers was cut with a machete, bashed, kicked, stomped, and then twice shot in the head.

""The offending involved a protracted, sadistic and brutal torturing of Ms Landers over a period of hours,"" Justice Dalton said.

The motivation for the killing, she said, stemmed from Appleton's suspicion Ms Landers was having an affair with Harris, and stealing her clothes and jewellery.

Justice Dalton said Appleton was so obsessed with the idea of revenge that she began plotting it from inside jail seven days before Ms Landers' killing.

A letter of apology from the 43-year-old was given to the Landers family on Friday, but Justice Dalton said she had great difficulty reconciling it with the evidence.

Appleton and 44-year-old Harris, who at one point held hands in the dock during sentencing, initially pleaded not guilty to the murder but reversed their pleas after five days of evidence in their trial.

It followed guilty pleas to interfering with her corpse and depriving the liberty of two men, Jake McKenzie and Ryan Morgan.

During the trial, Mr McKenzie told the court a fight had escalated at the couple's home after Appleton slashed open Ms Landers' leg with a machete.

Harris eventually retrieved a gun and shot her in the head, but she was ""still alive enough to say no"" before being fired on a second time.

During sentencing, the court heard Harris had previously been jailed for manslaughter in a case with striking similarities to Ms Landers' murder.

In that case, the victim's body was also wrapped up and dumped in the Beerburrum forest.

In a powerful victim impact statement read out in court, Ms Landers' mother Mary said it was difficult to convey how the brutal crime had affected her life.

""There are no words adequate to describe the pain, anger and despair that I have felt from her murder,"" she wrote.

""I have lost my faith and trust in people. I have trouble finding joy in the simple pleasures of life.""

Outside court, Haley Matthews said no sentence for her cousin's brutal killing would be enough for her family.

""While Harris and Appleton were handed life sentences ... this in our opinion is not justice,"" she said.

455,"Lumber Liquidators Holdings LL Chief Executive Bob Lynch has abruptly resigned, creating even more turmoil at the discount hardwood flooring retailer as it faces a federal probe into the safety of its products and dozens of lawsuits.

The company’s founder Thomas Sullivan will serve as CEO while Lumber Liquidators searches for a permanent replacement, Lumber Liquidators said in a statement Thursday, noting that the resignation had come “unexpectedly.” Lynch’s departure comes as another top executive, Chief Financial Officer Dan Terrell, is set to leave June 1.

Lumber Liquidators has been reeling since a report in March by television news program “60 Minutes” alleged the company sold Chinese-made laminate flooring with higher levels of formaldehyde than permitted under California’s health and safety standards. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is probing the matter. The controversy has taken a serious toll on Lumber Liquidators’ business: comparable sales fell 6.5% in March, and 7.2% in the first four weeks of April.

Its shares fell 15% on Thursday, adding to losses of 62% so far this year.

Earlier in May, Lumber Liquidators said it was dropping its controversial Chinese laminate flooring, a change in tack after it had previously stood by the flooring and assured customers the product was safe to install. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said that in addition to being a carcinogen, formaldehyde can cause irritation to the skin, eyes, nose and throat.

Adding to the drama swirling around the company, Lumber Liquidators is facing more than 100 class action lawsuits over the product, with allegations ranging from breach warranty to false advertising. What’s more, the Justice Department is considering criminal charges for illegal importation of oak flooring from protected Russian forests home to Siberian tigers.

456,"It appears to be a suicide: the victim is slumped on a kitchen table, dishes unwashed, empty spirit glass, gun on the floor. But why? What pushed this poor squirrel to such desperate lengths?

Visitors to the Whitechapel Gallery in London can speculate for themselves – nut-rationing? Tired of being chased by toddlers? – as the work and others by the art world's master joker Maurizio Cattelan go on display for 10 weeks.

The artwork is owned by Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, who began collecting Cattelan's work in the early 1990s. In 1996, visiting London, she fell in love with, and bought, the dead squirrel. ""It is full of nostalgia and at the same time, energy and is very representative of Maurizio,"" she said.

""He is an artist who is always able to talk about things without saying this is how it is, he gives us the opportunity, the possibility to think and talk about important political and social things. It is not just art to decorate walls.""

The dead squirrel raises all sorts of discussions. Is it a meditation on social mobility? The work is called Bidibidobidiboo, the Fairy Godmother's spell to transform Cinderella – but no one was ever going to transform this squirrel, living in such dingy surroundings with little hope of escape to a better life. It was, in every sense of the word, stuffed.

Or is it a much more personal piece? The kitchen is modelled on the one Cattelan grew up in and the artist has talked about how his mother accidentally left a hot iron on the yellow Formica table. To save it, his father sawed off the end with the burn mark leaving the family to always eat their meals on an absurdly shrunken table.

The squirrel is a key work in the collection and one of eight Cattelan works on display at the Whitechapel, many not seen in the UK for more than 20 years. They travel to London as the gallery continues its project to show works from collections that are rarely seen by the public in the UK. The works from the Sandretto Re Rebaudengo Foundation collection based in Turin follow previous displays of work from the collection of Dimitris Daskalopoulos as well as work from the British Council and Government Art Collections.

It also represents a rare opportunity to see so many Cattelan works in the same place. There have not been that many Cattelan shows, often because he is something of a nightmare for curators.

When the Guggenheim in New York staged a Cattelan retrospective last year, he asked that the works – almost his entire artistic output – should be strung up in the museum's central atrium, like an enormous mobile. Perhaps because it was a mid-career retrospective Cattelan then retired, aged 51.

Cattelan has never shied from controversy and some of his best known work includes The Ninth Hour, showing the Pope struck by a meteor, and HIM showing a suited Hitler kneeling in the pleading position.

The works in the Whitechapel display demonstrate Cattelan's political edge beyond the humour, such as a piece called Lullaby, which is a bag of rubble taken from the Contemporary Art Pavilion in Milan after it was damaged in a Mafia-related bomb attack in 1993. Next to it is a red neon Christmas greeting with the logo of the Red Brigades as a kind of star of Bethlehem.

457,"WASHINGTON —Melinda Gates, the philanthropist and mother of three, gathered from listening to her children and their friends that the next generation of American spouses expects to evenly split the household chores.

‘‘I’m sorry to say this, but if you think that, you’re wrong,’’ she wrote to high-schoolers Monday in her annual open letter, penned with her husband, Bill Gates. ‘‘Unless things change, girls today will spend hundreds of thousands more hours than boys doing unpaid work simply because society assumes it’s their responsibility.’’

She backed her case with global data. Women worldwide devote an average of 4.5 hours each day to unpaid work — cooking, cleaning, changing the baby’s diaper. Men contribute less than half that much time, according to the OECD.

The domestic division of labor remains staggeringly unbalanced in the United States, where female breadwinners now support 40 percent of homes. Women here typically spend two hours and 12 minutes daily on housework, while men spend one hour and 21 minutes.

A 2015 survey by Working Mom, furthermore, found that female breadwinners who lived with male partners still reported handling the bulk of the grocery shopping, meal preparation, bill-paying, and cleaning.

‘‘This isn’t a global plot by men to oppress women,’’ Melinda Gates wrote. ‘‘It’s more subtle than that. The division of work depends on cultural norms, and we call them norms because they seem normal — so normal that many of us don’t notice the assumptions we’re making. But your generation can notice them — and keep pointing them out until the world pays attention.’’

(Bill Gates, it should be noted, drives their kids to school every other day.)

Mothers in the United States who work full time, year round, make an average of $40,000, compared to $56,999 paid to fathers, according to the National Women’s Law Center. That’s 70 cents to the dollar.

Economists say this disparity probably comes from a blend of factors: Women are sometimes ‘‘mommy tracked,’’ or passed over for high-profile projects or promotions, when employers assume motherhood (but not fatherhood) zaps productivity. A 2015 study from the University of Georgia found that, for this reason, expectant mothers are often afraid to tell their bosses they’re pregnant.

Women do take more time off to tend to family, but that’s not always a choice. Sometimes, as the data show, husbands just don’t pull their domestic weight. They also tend to prioritize their careers over their wives’, while wives tend to equally prioritize both partners’ careers, according to a 2014 study of 25,000 Harvard Business School graduates.

Evidence for the wife (or husband) penalty shows up in what researchers call the ‘‘lesbian wage premium.’’ Across years of research, women who have never lived with a male partner make more money than women who have.

Last year, Marieka Klawitter, a professor of public policy at the University of Washington, examined 29 studies across the Western Hemisphere on wages and sexual orientation and found a 9 percent earnings premium for lesbians over heterosexual women. Gay men, meanwhile, faced an 11 percent penalty, compared to straight men.

She controlled for parenthood and concluded that lesbians simply had more education and work experience than the general female population.

But another study from the University of Nevada, which used national data from the year 2000, adds a stunning asterisk to Klawitter’s findings: Lesbians who had previously lived with male partners made 20 percent less than those who’d never cohabitated with a husband figure.",The philanthropist and mother of three says global data show women’s work is still not as highly valued as men’s.,"Generated Summary: WASHINGTON —Melinda Gates, the philanthropist and mother of three, gathered from listening to her children and their friends that the next generation of American spouses expects to evenly split the household chores."
458,"Apple’s marketing machine will be spinning at warp speed at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco starting Monday. But marketing can only do so much.

The five-day event will be an opportunity for Apple to prove to the world that it can still innovate. With the smartphone and tablet markets increasingly saturated, the tech giant is under growing pressure to come up with the next big thing.

The Worldwide Developer Conference, or WWDC, is usually where Apple unveils software updates for its products. Upgraded laptops, desktops, and, occasionally, entirely new services are also frequently carted out onstage.

Last year, for example, Apple used WWDC to introduce a Spotify-like music streaming service that costs $10 monthly. Although hardly revolutionary, Apple Music has gained good traction with 13 million subscribers at the end of the last quarter.

Music is just part of a bigger push by Apple CEO Tim Cook to expand his company’s focus beyond gadgets to what he calls services, a catch-all that includes the App Store (which co-founder Steve Wozniak thinks is the company’s most important product ever) and the Apple Pay mobile wallet. They give Apple a steady revenue stream that is independent of selling more iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

What to expect at this year’s WWDC beyond the typical is anyone’s guess. Perhaps Apple will make Siri, its voice-activated personal assistant, available to outside developers to include in their apps and products. It would be one way to counter the threat of Amazon and its smart home hub, Echo, and its voice assistant, Alexa, which can turn off the lights on command and order an Uber.

But what you can count on Monday is Cook casting even the most minor product tweaks as innovative breakthroughs. Whether it will be enough to appease investors and return Apple’s shares to their highs of a year ago is another story.

459,"Victorian farmers have launched a new brand of milk in a bid to lure customers away from supermarkets' $1 litre labels and raise funds to support struggling farmers in southeast Australia.

Farmers' Fund milk will launch this week in Victorian supermarkets as the peak body for dairy farmers says $1 per litre private-label milk, such as those sold in Coles and Woolworths, has ""eroded"" the amount of money in the dairy supply chain.

""The $1 litre milk policy has seen a shift in total sales consumption ... in essence that means less money going through from processors ... through to the farm sector,"" Dairy Australia trade and industry strategy group manager Charlie McElhone told AAP.

The Farmers' Fund milk will be produced by Murray Goulburn Co-operative and Coles under licence from the Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF).

Forty cents from every two-litre bottle, to be priced at about $2.50, will go to a fund that supplies grants of up to $20,000 to dairy farmers hurt by falling milk prices.

The first round of grants will be delivered in mid-October.

The private-label milk still holds a fair chunk of the market and hopefully the new milk could claw some of that back to farmers, VFF president David Jochinke said.

""If you are buying the home brand milk this is your opportunity to invest in the industry,"" Mr Jochinke said.

""This is a product you should value. This isn't a product that just grows on trees or just falls out of cows, there is a lot of work that goes behind it,"" he said.

Coles first flagged a similar idea in June but the Victorian Farmers Federation's announcement is the first detailed information on how the milk will help farmers directly.

Consumer-led boycotts have hit Coles and Woolworths private-label, as the grocery giants continue to sell the milk at $1 per litre, with its market share dropping from 65 per cent to around 50 per cent, Mr McElhone said.

""Consumers are not comfortable about the fact that milk is so cheap, and in many cases cheaper than bottled water,"" he said.

Earlier this year Murray Goulburn, a dairy co-operative which supplies milk across Australia, retrospectively slashed how much it paid farmers for their milk, leaving many to pay back the difference to the company.

The company cut the price after its predictions the milk market would recover from a global glut failed to materialise.

Its predicted price paid to farmers of $6.05 kilogram in July 2015 fell to between $4.75-$5.00 a kilogram in April 2016.

Although the milk will only be available in Victorian Coles supermarkets to begin with, if it was successful the VFF would consider moving into other markets, Mr Jochinke said.","A new milk brand will be sold in Victorian supermarkets to raise funds for farmers in south eastern Australia, amid pressure on retailers to pay more for milk.",Generated Summary: Victorian farmers have launched a new brand of milk in a bid to lure customers away from supermarkets' $1 litre labels and raise funds to support struggling farmers in southeast Australia.

The software giant blamed its lack of sales growth on the strong U.S. dollar weighing down its overseas business. Here are the key points from Tuesday’s third-quarter earnings report.

What you need to know: Oracle ORCL posted the same third-quarter revenue year-over-year: $9.3 billion. That total came up short of Wall Street’s expectations, as analysts had predicted $9.46 billion in sales. Oracle also reported declining profits for the quarter. The company earned $2.49 billion last quarter, or 57 cents per share, which is down slightly from $2.56 billion in the same quarter last year.

Oracle blamed its flat sales and profit drop on unfavorable currency fluctuations, as the company said it would have posted a 6% bump in revenue, along with a 7% gain in profits, based on a stable exchange rates.

“Once you normalize for exchange rates, it was a very strong growth quarter for us,” co-CEO Safra Catz said in a statement.

The big number: Oracle also announced a 25% rise to its quarterly dividend, from 12 cents per share to 15 cents, with shareholders set to receive the cash return in April.

The market reacted favorably to the increased dividend. Oracle’s stock fell initially in after-hours trading, but then swiftly rallied to gain about 2%.

What you might have missed: Oracle has placed a lot of focus on its cloud business, which still makes up only about 6% of the company’s overall revenue even though sales were up almost 30% in the third quarter.

The results mark the first time Trump has been dislodged from the top of the broad Republican field in months, and reflect continued preference for outsider candidates more than 13 months before the 2016 presidential election.

The New York Times/CBS News survey on Tuesday showed Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon who has never held public office, was the presidential pick of 26 percent of respondents, compared with 22 percent for Trump, although the difference lay within the margin of error of six percentage points.

Senator Marco Rubio is third with eight per cent, while Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and the son and brother of two presidents, is tied at seven per cent with former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina.

In a securities filing on Thursday, the retailer disclosed Wilson’s entire stake of 20.1 million shares could be sold at a maximum offering price of $60.95, valuing his 14.2% stake in Lululemon LULU at $1.23 billion. In the filing, it was also indicated that over 10 million additional shares would be offered by two investment companies that Wilson controls, as well as nearly 270,000 shares held by Wilson’s wife Shannon, who also previously worked at the company.

Wilson’s representative was quick to add that the filing didn’t indicate a stock sale was immediately planned.

“The prospectus supplement filed by Lululemon simply enables Chip Wilson to sell his shares in the future, if he chooses to do so, on the same basis as any other stockholder,” a Wilson representative said.

The relationship between Wilson and the yoga maker he founded in 1998 has at times been a difficult one. He successfully served as Lululemon CEO from 1998 to 2005, building a cult-like brand that lured women that were looking for stylish gear for yoga and other athletic pursuits. The clothing has also increasingly been worn as everyday street wear, participating in the broader “athleisure” trend that is still very popular.

But last year, he called for a shakeup of the company’s board that led to an awkward standstill between Lululemon and its founder. He quit the retailer’s board in February so he found focus on a new business called Kit & Ace, a luxury brand founded by his wife Shannon and Wilson’s son.

Some analysts praised the news as a positive step for the retailer, which on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly sales.

465,"U.S. stock markets had a Super Tuesday, with the S&P 500 gaining 2.39%, but the latest moves haven’t quieted Wall Street fears of a coming recession.

Though most economists don’t see a recession coming this year, the number that do are on the rise. If and when it does come, analysts are starting to worry that the recession will be longer than most. “If a recession were to occur, it might be shallow but somewhat more extended than the 1990 and 2001 episodes since interest rates can’t be lowered as much,” said Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist for HSBC Securities, to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The reason? The Federal Reserve doesn’t have nearly the room it is used to having, in terms of the ability to lower interest rates, as it usually does. Economist David Beckworth recently explained the problem in an essay for the Financial Times:

The real reason for this [problem] is the Fed’s firm commitment to low inflation. Like a governor placed on a truck’s engine to control its speed, a commitment to low inflation helps prevent the economy from growing too fast. Normally, this is a good thing. But sometimes it can backfire. A truck driver may need to temporarily go faster to make up for lost time after being stuck in traffic. Similarly, an economy may need to temporarily speed up to get back to its full potential after a recession. Neither can happen with a rigid adherence to the speed limit.

Beckworth argues that the Fed should abandon its inflation target for a nominal growth target instead. This would allow the Fed to tolerate higher inflation during periods of low growth (as we are experiencing now), to be made up for with periods of lower inflation when growth is strong.

Not everyone buys Beckworth’s argument that nominal growth targeting will be a cure-all. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers, for instance, has given a half-endorsment to the idea, but has been much more forceful in his argument that today’s low inflation environment is a signal that governments around the world should be spending more to prop up weak demand.",Because the Fed isn't ready to fight it.,Generated Summary: U.

Though Fields said Ford has ""had conversations with the transition team"" for the incoming president, his comments, made during a keynote speech marking the opening of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, could escalate a sometimes sharp dispute that began early during the election campaign. It was touched off by Ford's announcement it would shift small car production from U.S. plants to a new factory in Mexico.

""We've got to keep (factories) here. It's not that hard to do,"" then-candidate Trump said during one campaign interview, adding that if Ford and other makers continued to expand in Mexico, ""pretty soon all we're going to have is nursing home jobs.""

Earlier this year, Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. met with Trump to discuss what the grandson of company founder Henry Ford describe as ""infuriating"" attacks. Ford executives stressed that they were replacing production of slow-selling small cars like the Focus with high-demand light truck models such as the F-150 pickup.

That failed to quell the dispute, the idea of tearing up trade deals such as NAFTA and a yet-unapproved trans-Pacific pact becoming a centerpiece of the Trump campaign. There have been some signs that the New York businessman might pull back from such tariffs, though with the transition process reportedly in turmoil it has become difficult to tell precisely where the next administration will position itself once in office.

'Free Trade is a Must'

Fields used his keynote speech to send a message that aggressive anti-trade moves would be risky, telling reporters and industry officials gathered in downtown Los Angeles that, ""A tariff like that (Trump has proposed) could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy.""

Fields tried to soften the tone of his comments, adding that there have been meetings with the transition team, and that, ""we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress.""

But free trade is a must for Ford, he added, Fields indicating that the second-largest U.S. automaker doesn't intend to back down from plans that it has, in the past, said are necessary to delivering an acceptable return on investment.

In fact, just hours before Fields delivered his morning keynote, Ford announced another move that could lead to further friction with Washington. The carmaker says it will begin selling a new entry-level SUV in the U.S. in 2018, with the little EcoSport coming off an assembly line in India.

That would mark the first time a major manufacturer has imported an Indian-made automobile, but others may follow — along with one of that country's biggest local producers, Mahinda & Mahindra.

Meanwhile, two automakers have begun importing vehicles from China, Volvo moving first with a stretched version of its S60 sedan dubbed Inscription. General Motors followed recently with the launch of the Chinese-made Buick Envision utility vehicle.

But Mexico, in particular, has been in the crosshairs for Donald Trump. The country has experienced explosive growth in its carmaking sector in recent years, becoming one of the five largest automotive manufacturing nations in the world.

Just this week, Toyota broke ground for a new assembly plant in the state of Guanajuato that will produce the world's best-selling vehicle, the Corolla. New plants run by Kia, Audi and Nissan's Infiniti brand went into production in recent months.

Industry planners say that low wages are only a part of the appeal. They also point to the need to balance operations around the world, sometimes shifting production bases to both keep plants operating efficiently and holding down costs.

""The automotive business is truly global. So, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders,"" said Joe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting. ""It's how you keep the costs down.""

Other automotive insiders have begun weighing in, though cautiously, many worried about going on the record and getting off on a bad foot with the new administration.

""I am sure free and fair trade is a better way for all of us,"" said Ralf Speth, CEO of British-based Jaguar Land Rover. Though the German-born executive insisted he was not criticizing Trump, or any specific U.S. trade plans, he stressed his belief that trade barriers ""only make things more difficult and, at the end of the day, this takes buying power away from the people.""","Ford CEO Mark Fields warned that Trump's proposed trade plans would have a ""huge impact"" on the entire American economy, not just the auto industry.","Generated Summary: Ford CEO Mark Fields warned that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade plans would have a ""huge impact"" on the entire American economy, including a 35 percent tariff on motor vehicles imported from Mexico would have a ""huge impact"" on the entire American economy, not just the auto industry."
468,"Palestinian President Yasir Arafat says he is unfazed by the US veto of a United Nations resolution demanding Israel not harm the veteran leader.

""We are not shaken by a resolution from one place or another,"" said Arafat on Wednesday from his compound in the occupied West Bank city of Ram Allah.

""We are more important than any resolution.""

US ambassador to the UN John Negroponte was the only member to veto on Tuesday the text calling on Israel to ""desist from any act of deportation and cease any threat"" to Arafat on grounds it did not condemn Palestinian resistance activities.

Palestinians, on their part, expressed concerns that Washington is turning its back on the ""road map"" aimed at ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

US policy has become a ""hostage"" to Israel, said Palestinian cabinet minister Yasir Abd Rabbu.

Palestinian chief peace negotiator Saib Uraikat said the US move could be seen by Israeli leaders as a green light to assassinate Arafat.

""It's a black day for the United Nations and for international law,"" he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government sparked international outcries after announcing it would ""remove"" Arafat. While it did not specify actions it would take, some Israelis suggested killing him.

Palestinians have rallied dailysince Isreal threatened Arafat

""This is a clear announcement that the American administration is not willing to live up to its commitments under the road map,"" said Abd Rabbu.

An advisor to Sharon, Dore Gold, accused Security Council members of ignoring what he said was violence against Israelis.

A war of words erupted between UN members within hours of the resolution - demanding Israel neither harm nor deport Arafat - being put to vote.

The resolution fell after America voted against the motion, while Britain, Bulgaria and Germany abstained leaving the remaining 11 members voting for.

The resolution was drafted by Palestinian UN envoy Nasir al-Kidwa and sponsored by Syria.

""Israel found itself in an Orwellian situation by which its war on terrorism was to be judged in a Security Council resolution sponsored by Syria, one of the main state supporters of terrorism in the world,"" Gold said.

But Syrian UN envoy Faisal Mikdad called the veto ""regrettable"" and said Israel ""should not be a member of the United Nations because it is not a peace-loving country.

""Syria believes that Israel is responsible for its illogical policy and Israel is as well responsible for having scuttled the peace process in the Middle East,"" he said.

After the vote, Negroponte joined other council members in warning Israel the veto did not mean it should harm Arafat or send him into exile.

""Just to remind you that today is the 21st anniversary of the massacre of Sabra and Shatila. Do you remember that? Do you remember Mr. Sharon?"" Nasir al-Kidwa, Palestinian UN envoy

During nearly eight hours of harsh debate in the 15-nation Security Council on Monday, more than 40 governments condemned the decision to get rid of Arafat.

As he addressed the Security Council after the vote, al-Kidwa recalled the 1982 massacre of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon by Israeli-backed Lebanese militia.

The massacre took place while Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was defence minister. Sharon was later found indirectly responsible by an Israeli enquiry and sacked from his post. ""Just to remind you that today is the 21st anniversary of the massacre of Sabra and Shatila. Do you remember that? Do you remember Mr. Sharon?"" al-Kidwa said.

Meanwhile, Israel's Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel should consider a truce made by a Palestinian security adviser.

469,"Weary Greece has braced for more painful austerity as Alexis Tsipras was sworn in as prime minister with a mandate to drive through unpopular reforms agreed with the nation's international creditors.

As a torrential downpour swept Athens on Monday, Tsipras took his second oath of office in eight months and got ready to unveil a cabinet that will have to apply tough economic reforms he signed onto in July.

""On my honour and conscience, I pledge to uphold the constitution and laws"" of Greece, he said.

Earlier he told President Prokopis Pavlopoulos that a coalition government with the nationalist Independent Greeks party - his allies in the last cabinet - would be sworn in by Wednesday morning.

On the same day, Tsipras will travel to Brussels for a summit on the refugee crisis, where he will also represent Cyprus.

Some 310,000 migrants and refugees have landed on Greek shores from Turkey this year, most of them Syrians fleeing their country's civil war.

France, Germany, Spain and European Council president Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday pledged to help crisis-hit Greece, both on the economic front and in dealing with the worsening migrant crisis.

But EU partners wasted no time in reminding Greece to get down to work pushing through reforms laid out in a rescue package worth up to 86 billion euros ($A135 billion).

""Looking forward to swift formation of new government with strong mandate to continue reform process,"" Eurogroup president and Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said.

From buying a loaf of bread to a visit to the doctor, pain lies in store as the new government readies to raise taxes and rewrite the economic rule-book in line with tough reforms demanded by the country's lenders in return for Greece's third international rescue in five years.

""There's a lot of work ahead and no time to lose,"" Juncker said.

""As you know well, you can count on the European Commission and on me personally to stand by Greece and support the new government in its efforts.""

The economic to-do list was signed in July by Tsipras in a controversial deal that alienated anti-euro hardliners who then quit his Syriza party, stripping the premier of his majority and triggering Sunday's general election.

With all votes counted in the September 20 ballot, Syriza secured 35.46 per cent of the vote, close to an absolute majority of 145 seats in the country's 300-seat parliament.

Coalition partner ANEL is providing another 10 politicians.

Tsipras, who had justified the deal he signed in July with European leaders as saving Greece from a chaotic exit from the eurozone, said the election victory would ""change the balance"" in Europe and strengthen Greece's fight against endemic corruption and hidden wealth.

471,"The U.S. Supreme Court is due on Monday to issue its first major abortion ruling since 2007 against a backdrop of unremitting divisions among Americans on the issue and a decades-long decline in the rate at which women terminate pregnancies.

The court’s decision on whether a Republican-backed 2013 Texas law placed an undue burden on women exercising their constitutional right to abortion is one of three remaining cases for the court to decide on Monday, the last day of its term. The other major one involves whether the justices will overturn the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell.

The last time the justices decided a major abortion case was nine years ago when they ruled 5-4 to uphold a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure.

High Stakes for Supreme Court Arguments on Abortion Case

Americans remain closely divided over whether abortion should be legal. In a Reuters/Ipso online poll involving 6,769 U.S. adults conducted from June 3 to June 22, 47% of respondents said abortion generally should be legal and 42 percent said it generally should be illegal.

Views on abortion in the United States have changed very little over the decades, according to historical polling data.

There has been a long decline in the U.S. abortion rate. The most recent data, from 2011, showed that there were an estimated 1.1 million abortions that year at a rate of 16.9 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion policy and supports abortion rights. The rate had peaked at 29 abortions per 1,000 women in 1981, the group said.

“We know that the recent abortion declines were primarily due to declines in unintended pregnancies. Improved contraceptive use is likely the key driver of the declines in both unintended pregnancy and abortion,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the institute.

The Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.

The law in Texas, one of a number of conservative states that have pursued restrictions on abortion, requires abortion doctors to have “admitting privileges,” a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. It also requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities.

For more on the Supreme Court, watch:

The court is evenly divided between liberals and conservatives following the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. The court could split 4-4, which would leave in place a lower court’s decision upholding the law.

In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans were nearly evenly split on whether they backed laws like the one in Texas, with 43 percent generally opposed and 41% generally supportive.

HourlyNerd said it has now secured more than $33 million and amassed a network of 25,000 business consultants, including experts with deep industry experience and diplomas from top business schools.

The Boston company, which started as a Harvard Business School project in 2013, bills itself as a lower-cost source of expert business consulting in an industry dominated by traditional firms such as McKinsey & Co. and Boston Consulting Group.

HourlyNerd doesn’t employ its consultants. Instead, it serves as a digital middleman, letting independent contractors bid on consulting projects posted by potential clients.

“This is a tipping point for our business,” said Rob Biederman, co-CEO and cofounder. “Top professionals are choosing to be independent — controlling where, when, and how they do business.”

These online expert networks could evolve into potent competition for some of the best-known management consulting firms.

HourlyNerd charges both the consultant and the client a fee for setting up each project and handling payments between the two.

473,"Ghana is bolstering its border protection as part of new security measures after reports that a potential attack by an armed group is ""real"".

A leaked intelligence memo published in Ghanaian media warned the West African country and its eastern neighbour, Togo, could be targeted by armed groups following deadly attacks in Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast in recent months

""Intelligence gathered by the ... NSCS [National Security Council Secretariat]Â indicates a possible terrorist attack on the country is real. ... The choice of Ghana according to the report is to take away the perception that only Francophone countries are the target,"" said the memo, dated April 9.

The memo reportedly referred to the confessions of a suspect who was interrogated by Ivorian authorities after an attack last month on Grand-Bassam, a popular tourist destination, that killed dozens.Â

It ordered immigration agents on the northern border with Burkina Faso to be extra vigilant and said patrols should be stepped up along informal routes between the two countries.

OPINION:Â An attack on Ivory Coast was inevitable

Francis Palmdeti, director of public affairs for Ghana's immigration service, told the DPA news agency on Friday the country is increasing border patrols and cooperation among security agencies.

Immigration authorities are also stepping up collaboration with managers of hotels, lodges and guest houses to obtain information on foreigners coming to the country, Palmdeti added, without commenting, however, on the leaked memo.

Speaking to local media, Ghanaian President John Mahama expressed disappointment about the leak andÂ urged people in the country to remain calm.

""I think that we must deal with this without creating panic among our people, and that is why the stories that we see in the papers are most unfortunate,"" the website citifmonline quoted the president as saying.

474,"Silicon Valley is notoriously competitive. Many of the best tech talents jump around from one company to another, often many times over. Still others leave established companies altogether to start new ventures of their own.

One challenge for those founders, however, is convincing talented and well-paid workers to join their upstart firm. Nick Weaver, CEO and co-founder of home networking company Eero, has managed to pull this off. His company, which has raised more than $40 million in funding, boasts a roster packed with veterans from Apple, Google, Twitter, and Amazon’s Lab126, to name a few. Eero’s new router, meanwhile, was designed by Fred Bould, whose profile also includes Nest’s thermostat and smoke detector as well as Roku’s set-top TV box.

According to Weaver, the secret to getting the best workers to join your staff is simple: Get to know them.

“I think in the recruitment process, a lot of people are pretty transactional,” says Weaver. “And if you really take the time to get to know people, you have a materially different outcome.”

That sounds simple enough, but it can take lots of time to build real connections with potential hires. That’s especially true if you don’t already have some kind of relationship with them.

“Some people on the [Eero] team, I’ve been getting to know for years,” says Weaver. “The people you hire end up not being short-term relationships, but they end up being relationships that you build over the course of years, if not decades.”

If you’re eyeballing someone in particular for your team, Weaver advises tracking down a mutual friend. “Go find a personal connection to that individual,” he says. “It’s a pretty small world and you’re typically only one degree away from just about anybody.”

One more crucial recruitment step, per Weaver: Communicating your company’s mission and growth strategy. “One thing you do as an entrepreneur is you’re constantly telling the story of your company,” says Weaver. “So you have to get really good at articulating it succinctly, and get people to understand that this is really going to be bigger than what it appears to be on the surface.”",How to recruit anybody to your company or cause,"Generated Summary: Silicon Valley is notoriously competitive.

475,"Opportunists' days of using self-serve checkouts to get a five-finger discount on items such as that extra avocado are over, NSW police and supermarkets warn.

A NSW crackdown on petty theft at chains such as Coles has been launched, with the retailer saying it's sick of customers who lie about what's in their basket to get a discount or who try and avoid paying altogether.

""No matter how small you think it is, even if it's the avocado and you're saving $2, it's still shoplifting,"" detective superintendent Murray Chapman told reporters outside a supermarket in Zetland, in inner Sydney, on Thursday.

Coles says it's caught roughly 11,000 customers stealing goods at its self-serve check outs across Australia over the past year.

""There has been a normalisation of theft at self-serve checkouts over the last few years,"" Coles spokeswoman Martine Alpins said.

""There's also a feeling that (because they're) not being served by a traditional checkout person, 'perhaps I have the entitlement'.""

But Coles said the machines weren't going anywhere because they were convenient and increased customer traffic.

Det Supt Chapman said he couldn't go into the specifics of the crackdown but warned potential thieves they wouldn't go unnoticed.

""You won't see the loss prevention officers visibly in a lot of centres and you won't see police,"" he said.

476,"Lending Club, the peer-to-peer small business lender, is ready to take itself public.

The almost 8-year-old company filed for an initial public offering worth $500 millionWednesday — a placeholder sum that’s used to calculate filing fees. The final sum the company raises could be much higher.

Lending Club had been valued at about $4 billion after a fundraising round earlier this summer.

The company is looking to raise funds amid the growing success of the peer-to-peer lending market, which includes competitors such as Prosper and Upstart. Lending Club has risen to the top of that market and is now the world’s largest online connector of borrowers and investors.

The company has originated over $5 billion in loans as of the end of June. In the six months through June 30, it originated about $1.8 billion of that total, 125% more than over the same period a year earlier, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission

The graphic below, included as part of its filing, showsLending Club’s exponential growth in loan originations since 2007, along with key company milestones.

“We have pretty ambitious goals,” Renaud Laplanche, Lending Club’s CEO, told Fortune in March. “We want to transform the banking system into a marketplace that is more competitive, more consumer-friendly, more transparent.”

The rapid growth in loans and Laplanche’s passion to expand the company’s reach reveals why major financial luminaries have become supporters. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack are both on Lending Club’s board of directors.

Lending Club doesn’t make loans directly. It provides the technology and online interface to connect individuals and institutions with small-scale borrowers. It makes money by charging transaction and servicing fees.

Total net revenues for the company have grown in line with its soaring loan originations. The company brought in $98 million last year, a 190% increase over revenue in 2012. As of June this year, it had brought in $86.9 million in revenue.

The company fills a financing niche left behind by the wider banking services market. Lending Club connects small businesses that previously were served primarily by the credit card market with affordable loans, most at an average rate of 14% interest. It uses technology and algorithms to match borrowers — and their default risk — with the the right investors.

Right now the company focuses on small businesses, but “over time, we want to offer all types of credit products including auto loans, student loans and mortgages,” Laplanche said.

Those types of loans may not be that far away. Lending Club plans to use the funds from its public offering to expand into other types of borrowing, and into more areas globally, according to its SEC filing.

477,"""Death is like going to Bloomingdale's,"" Andy Warhol once proclaimed – as benign and enjoyable as a trip to New York's most famous clothing emporium.

The revered pop artist, who would have turned 85 on Tuesday, has long since left for the great department store in the sky. But fans can now look in on Andy from anywhere in the world – because a webcam has been installed overlooking his grave.

It's been set up by the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, which oversees the artist's archive and exhibits contemporary art. The new perpetual live feed is part of an ongoing project by Madelyn Roehrig, a Pittsburgh artist who has spent years investigating Warhol's resonance today. The project is called Figment, a title borrowed from something Warhol wrote in 1985 about his death: ""I always thought I'd like my own tombstone to be blank. No epitaph and no name. Well, actually, I'd like it to say 'figment'.""

Warhol would surely have been pleased at the continued attention – and he probably wouldn't have disliked its morbid character either. Death, and humans' fascination with death, runs through Warhol's work like a golden thread. His most powerful silkscreen paintings of the 1960s come from the Death and Disaster series: serially repeated images of electric chairs and fatal car accidents. His famous portraits of Marilyn Monroe only began after the actress's demise; the example at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, her head surrounded by a great expanse of gold, recalls Byzantine funerary portraiture. When Valerie Solanas shot him in 1968, his first impulse after recovering was to turn his scarred body into an image.

Warhol died in 1987, at the age of 58, after a minor operation to his gallbladder. It merited a front-page story in the New York Times and a special tribute on American television news. Yet while many admirers remember the massive, glamorous memorial service his friends threw on Fifth Avenue a few months later, the artist's actual funeral and burial were much more sober events.

He insisted on being buried in his home town of Pittsburgh, in an unprepossessing Catholic cemetery on the outskirts of town. Watching the webcam today, viewers can see Warhol's simple tombstone, bearing only his name and dates of birth and death, garlanded with flowers and balloons. (There are also half a dozen Campbell's soup cans that devotees have left in tribute.) Just behind Andy's grave you can see another tombstone, marking the resting place of his parents, Julia and Andrej, who emigrated from present-day Slovakia to the US. Their tombstone reads ""Warhola"" – the artist's original Slovak surname, which he shortened when he struck out in New York. But Warhol remained a devout Catholic his entire life, and his funeral was a traditional service in Pittsburgh: an open-coffin affair, for which Warhol wore a black cashmere suit and platinum wig.

The webcam will broadcast footage from Warhol's grave 24 hours a day, always from the same spot and with no editing. In that way it recalls some of the artist's most famous films: Sleep, which depicts his friend in bed for more than five hours, or Empire, a continuous eight-hour shot of a New York skyscraper. Warhol died long before the advent of the web and social media, of course – yet while he would have adored those innovations, in some way he also foresaw them. Non-stop broadcast, endless conversation, fame for everyone and no one: these are the markers of our age, but they were originally Andy's idea.",Jason Farago: The artist who foresaw the rise of celebrity culture will now have a perpetual live feed from his grave in Pittsburgh,"Generated Summary: ""Death is like going to Bloomingdale's,"" Andy Warhol once proclaimed – as benign and enjoyable as a trip to New York's most famous clothing emporium."
